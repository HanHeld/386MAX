Workaround Stealth Bug In QEMM

When the user runs our DOS setup program on a system which has an
ABIOS, we make some calls to see which adapters are installed (we're
checking for a Kingston memory board).	Alas, their stealth doesn't
properly emulate the ABIOS, so the system crashes.

The workaround is to check for QEMM and skip the POS initialization,
meaning we'll take our lumps if there is a Kingston memory board in
the system.

PD_SUB.ASM	Define routine to determine QEMM presence.

MXZ_ADF.C	Before calling posinit(), ensure QEMM is not in the
		  system.
