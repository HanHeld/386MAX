Move Registration Screen To Conform to US & German Versions

The edit fields for the registration screen in the US and German
versions are tricky to place on the screen because the text is
different enough for the screens to have a different # lines.  The
problem really is that the row numbers of the edit fields are
calculated negatively, that is from the bottom.  By changing the row
numbers for the "Name" and "Company Name" fields to be positive (from
the top), both versions can be accommodated.

At the same time, I centered the serial number edit field on the
screen, and moved some text to the left to display better.
