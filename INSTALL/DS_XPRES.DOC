Fix Bug When Calculating CRC

When we calculate a 128 KB CRC in a system in which 386MAX is not
present, we use a routine which depends upon the base address of the
system ROM being set to E000.  Alas, this isn't done as yet, now it
is.

Also, if the BCF file isn't found, don't whine about it.

And finally, if there's no EMS handler (INT 67h = 0:0), install a
temporary handler in case the memory manager picks off the VCPI INT
67h calls from the PM IDT.

DRVE.C		Ensure the source BCF file exists and is readable
		  before calling copy() which will complain if the
		  file doesn't exist.

MISC.C		Call MAXPRES() before calculating the CRC so set
		  various variables.

VCPI_CRC.ASM	In GETBCRC(), if the INT 67h address is 0:0, install a
		  temporary handler.
