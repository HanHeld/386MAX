Merge BlueMAX Into Qualitas MAX

The DOS setup program needs to include BlueMAX capabilities as part of
Qualitas MAX instead of as a separate compile-time option.  For the
most part, this means ensuring that REDUIT is set to 1, and copying
the appropriate BCF file to the hard disk.

Also, because the BCF files are present on Disk #2 in unpackaged form,
we no longer copy them all to the hard disk (and then optionally
delete all but the one we're going to use).

If the current memory manager is not 386MAX, we need to use the VCPI
form of entering PM in order to calculate the BIOS CRC.

Finally, we fix a bug where we do not properly calculate whether or
not there's a valid previous installation.  The proper way is to
ensure that we have one file from either a valid 386MAX or BlueMAX
installation for each of three categories (the device driver, the
386UTIL.COM, and 386LOAD.COM).	Previously, we had the inner and outer
loops reversed.  Along with this, we mistakenly copy a previous
installation's serial # as the new serial #, and if the new serial #
displays on two line, the checksum becomes invalid and the user is
told to run the install program again (which, of course, perpetuates
the same mistake).

COMMON.H	Remove BlueMAX definitions and #if REDUIT as there's
		  no other choice.

COMPILE.H	#define REDUIT to be 1 for 386MAX.

INSTEXT.H	Define message text to display when copying BCF file.

DRVE.C		Delete REDUIT-specific code which deletes extra BCF
		  files.
		Define DO_BCFEXTRACT() to extract (really copy) the
		  appropriate BCF file to the destination
		  subdirectory.

INSTALL.C	Call DO_BCFEXTRACT at appropriate time.

MISC.C		In CALC_CRCINFO(), use algorithm in VCPI_CRC.ASM if
		  not in real mode and 386MAX not present.

SECURITY.C	Fix bug checking for valid previous installation.
		Fix bug where we copy the previous serial # as the new
		  serial # and clobber the leading byte if the new
		  serial # is in a two-line format thus invalidating
		  the checksum.
