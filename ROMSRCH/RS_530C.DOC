Workaround Bug In Phoenix BIOS

The Advanced Power Management (APM) function 530Ch should return the
Power Status of system devices.  Instead, on the Phoenix BIOS version
4.03 (copyright 1987-1994), it crashes the system.

Like the proverbial doctor, the solution is don't walk that way.

FUNCS.ASM	Omit testing APM function 530Ch.
