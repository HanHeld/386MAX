Remove Disabling Code For BIOS Mouse Calls

In the very beginning of ROMSRCH (back when it was still called
PROBE), a test was put in to skip exercising the BIOS mouse calls
unless a mouse driver was present.  We have a system in the testlab
for which the BIOS code for these functions is in a separate 4KB block
which we mistakenly recover.  This TWT deletes the disabling code so
that we now always test these functions so as to mark as much of the
BIOS as in use as possible.

FUNCS.ASM	Delete disabling code.
