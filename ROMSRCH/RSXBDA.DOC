Workaround Bug In MASM

It apears that MASM has a different idea about the name of a segment
and seg of the name of a segment.  LINK doesn't care, but QLINK does,
so I'm changing it.  At the same time, I replaced constant 40h with
seg BIOSDATA where appropriate.

PROBE,ASM	Use seg BIOSDATA instead of constant 40h.
		Use seg BIOSDATA instead of BIOSDATA.
