Workaround Bug In Some IBM Value Point BIOSes

During normal processing of ROMSRCH, we exercise the NMI interrupt
02h.  The response to this software interrupt on some IBM Value Point
systems is to display a message "Unexpected type 02 interrupt" and
CLI/HLT which stops the processor dead in its tracks.

Because HLT is a privileged instruction, it actually signals a GP
Fault when executed in VM, so we have a means by which we can overcome
this rude behavior.  In particular, we can tell 386MAX.SYS to reflect
the CLI/HLT to VM as an INT 02h at which point our handler takes over
and continues execution as if nothing happened.

At the same time, I restricted the behavior of PnP testing so as to
exercise the event notification functions only if that feature is
supported.

Also, I removed the separate version number from ROMSRCH so that it
now tracks the version number of 386MAX.

MAKEFILE	Define action for assembling VERSRET.ASM from the
		  386MAX directory.
		Include VERSRET.ASM in the mix of source files as we
		  now get our version number from there.

PROBE.INC	Define flag to indicate we toggled the @DBG_HLT flag
		  in 386MAX's DBG_FLAG.

FUNCS.ASM	If INT 02h, tell 386MAX to reflect CLI/HLT to VM as an
		  INT 02h.  Note that the address of the INT 02h
		  called by ROMSRCH is in INT_VECTOR and the address
		  of the INT 02h called by 386MAX in response to a
		  CLI/HLT is in 0:4*02h.
		If event notification is not supported by this PnP
		  BIOS, don't exercise functions 03h-05h.

PROBE.ASM	Define and make public the DBG_FLAG word in the 386MAX
		  info structure.

VERSION.ASM	Bump the beta version #.
		Delete the major/minor version # as we now get it from
		  VERSRET.ASM.
