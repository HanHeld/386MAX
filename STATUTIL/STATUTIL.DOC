Copy STATUTIL from Dispatch and add Zopen.cpp

Fix file entry:

* Copy STATUTIL from Dispatch and add Zopen.cpp

 Description:
 	This project now lives under the p:\max hierarchy and is available
	for use by MAX 8 or any other new projects we add.
 Who: HENRY
 When: 4 Apr 96.
 SW/HW Environment: All.
 Symptom: NAB
 Temporary Workaround: NAB
 Test Procedure: None.
 QA Testing Passed:
 Version: None (static link library for use with multiple products).

New files:

INCLUDE\CTIMEDT.H
	Time/date class declaration.

INCLUDE\DTIME.H
	Basic date/time definitions.  Originally from CATSYM.H.

INCLUDE\GSTRING.H
	Handy but crude global string object.  Uses GlobalAlloc, _not_ _fmalloc().

INCLUDE\STATUTIL.H
	STATUTIL.H from Dispatch, with a few changes.  There are probably a
	couple of little white lies in here (referencing some of these functions
	will cause a link error) but we'll deal with those as needed.  These
	should all be useful functions, but some may need to be divorced from
	Dispatch-specific stuff in other modules.

INCLUDE\ZOPEN.H
	Zip / Unzip access class.  Missing from here is a way to register
	a yield / message display callback, but for simple operations like
	getting one file at a time it should not be a problem.

	Also the AddToZip / GetFromZip could take multiple filespecs (separated
	by space) but don't currently handle this properly.

STATUTIL\ACCESS.CPP
	A variant on _access() that handles localized filenames properly.

STATUTIL\CTIMEDT.CPP
	Implementation of time/date manipulation class.  Assignments
	are all done using YYMMDDHHMMSS (LPDTIME).

STATUTIL\GETDIR.CPP
	Functions to assert trailing backslash and make temporary filenames.

STATUTIL\GSTRING.CPP
	Global string class implementation.

STATUTIL\HASH.C
	Hashing algorithm from CATSYM, using a large 16-bit prime to take
	full advantage of the possible range of 16-bit values.

STATUTIL\SECURITY.C
	Weak encrypt / decrypt using static key.  Not good for anything
	other than hiding the original value from your kid sister, but
	that's as good as many products do for encryption.

STATUTIL\STATUTIL.INC
	Dependencies for STATUTIL (other than MASM).

STATUTIL\STATUTIL.MAK
	Project makefile.  Can be invoked without options to build
	non-debug version (which still has Codeview symbols attached).

STATUTIL\STKINFO.ASM
	Stack usage reporting.

STATUTIL\STRSTK.C
	String stack push / pop functions.

STATUTIL\TDUTIL.CPP
	Formatting and scanning of date/time according to [intl] section
	of WIN.INI.

STATUTIL\ZOPEN.CPP
	Zip access class implementation.

STATUTIL\ZOPEN.MAK
	Makefile for zopen testbed (zopentst.exe).

STATUTIL\ZOPENTST.CPP
STATUTIL\ZOPENTST.DEF
	Simple program to exercise zopen.cpp (also provides some usage
	examples).

	Typically new examples are added as we find the inevitably long
	list of things that don't work as advertised in the class.


Files affected:

MAX.MAK
	Minor change to allow disk to be built off-line (i.e. on my laptop).
	PACKAGE.EXE has also been checked in to the p:\max\tools project.

INCLUDE\TEXTNAME.MAK
	Add zip and unzip libraries and DLLs.
	Note that we need to register DynaZip before we can distribute it,
	and we need a separate list for non-MAX copying, so for now these
	DLLs are in with the .LIB files (which never get archived, just
	copied to the MAXROOT\lib directory).
