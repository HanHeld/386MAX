* Convert statutil library to 32bit version.

 Description: Convert statutil library to 32bit version. The changes were
     mainly to conditionally include the 32 bit headers, alias the large
     model function names ( ie. _fstrcpy ) to the standard ( ie. strcpy ),
     and remove __export for 32 bit compile. I have not changed the two time
     modules TDUTIL and CTIMEDT yet. They need more extensive rework.
     They are commented out in the makefile. Also, a few _far decls were 
     changed to FAR.
