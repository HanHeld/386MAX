Fix Bug Calculating Length of FMEMCPY

In a previous TWT, I limited the length of an FMEMCPY, but not
sufficiently so.  This time, the length limitation code is moved
inside of the loop (or as PVCS likes to portray it, the IF/FOR
statement which controls the loop is moved above the length limitation
code).	The loop searches through the result of DdeAccessData() which
returns a CR/LF-separated list of the members of the StartUp group.

SETUPDDE.C	Move length limitation code to inside loop which
		  checks the return from DdeAccessData().
