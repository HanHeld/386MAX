* Use stripm95.pif to set DOSMAX=ON in toolbox.exe in Win95.

Description: Use stripm95.pif to set DOSMAX=ON in Win95. This prevents
             a bug in the 386max.vxd from generating a page fault. The
             bug has been fixed, but it will trigger in previous versions
             during uninstall if DOSMAX is off and version 8.0 is still 
             active ( install then uninstall without rebooting ).
