* TOOLBOX.EXE range fix on USE= RAM= overlap

 Description: If you attempt to set contiguous memory blocks in USE= and
     RAM= statements (i.e. USE=EC00-F000 & RAM=F000-F200 ), the program
     will fail on the F000 overlap. Also discovered while fixing the
     initial complaint, It would also fail if the RAM= endpoint was
     greater than the USE= startpoint but not greater than the USE= 
     endpoint.
