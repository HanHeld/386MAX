* TOOLBOX.EXE - Don't leave evap.pif in Win95

 Description: (1) In fact, don't even use Evap.com in Win95. The limitation
     that evap.com was created to get around, that is, the inability to
     delete the file you are in within Windows, does not exist in Win95.
     So I just copied the delete functions from evap into misc.c (some
     were already there ) and now call them from the toolbox program if
     we are running in Win95. (2) Set NOFLEX in 386max.pro if RAM= changed. 

 Who: PETERJ
 When: 27 Oct 95
 SW/HW Environment: Win95
 Symptom: Evap.pif remains running after Uninstall.
 Temporary Workaround: manually close and delete evap.pif.
 Test Procedure: (1) Uninstall Max 8 from Win95. No trace should remain.
                 (2) Change RAM= via toolbox.exe and see that NOFLEX is
                 added to the 386MAX.pro file.
