Make Sensitive to W95

The offset in WinOldAp's DGROUP of certain VM handles changed with
Win95, a change which needs to be reflected in QPOPUP (who would've
thought?).

At the same time, I moved the .INI data from QPOPUP.INI to QMAX.INI so
as to have one less file to manage (as well as uninstall).

Also, I changed QPOPUP.VER to CVERSION.H thus eliminating duplicate
information already in MVERSION.H (which file is now included in
QPOPUP.RC).

MAKEFILE	Replace references to QPOPUP.VER with CVERSION.H.
		Note dependency of QPOPUP.RC on MVERSION.H.

CVERSION.H	Define new module for QPOPUP version info.

QPOPUP.H	Use QMAX.INI instead of QPOPUP.INI.

QPOPUP.C	Move read of "Debug" switch to earlier point so we can
		  use its value.
		If "Debug" switch is TRUE, signal INT 1.
		Delete code which creates the QPOPUP.INI (now
		  QMAX.INI) profile in case it doesn't exist as it
		  must (and it doesn't matter if it doesn't as that's
		  what default values are for).
		In GetWinOldApHWNDFromVMHandle(), make sensitive to
		  Win95's offsets within the WinOldAp DGROUP.

QPOPUP.RC	Replace references to QPOPUP.VER with CVERSION.H.
		Note dependency of QPOPUP.RC on MVERSION.H.
