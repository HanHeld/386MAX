Fix Bug Not Closing Go Ahead Driver

If MAX Meter opens the Go Ahead driver and for some reason finds that
the dirver is not usable (because it's disabled or isn't installed),
MAX Meter forgets to close the driver.	This presents a problem for
later programs which inquire as to Go Ahead's status (such as
GOAHEAD.EXE), making them think that Go Ahead is installed.  The fix
is to close the driver if MAX Meter doesn't use it.

At the same time, I deleted the check for whether or not Go Ahead is
enabled as Go Ahead can now be disabled (due to the presence of
incompatible drivers), but still be functional.

MAXMETER.C	Delete QUERYENABLE SendMessage() call.
		Close the Go Ahead driver if MAX Meter doesn't use it.
