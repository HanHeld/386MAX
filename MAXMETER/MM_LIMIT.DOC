* Remove forced limits on font size in maxmeter.

 Description: The font pointsize was set to 10 and the size option was removed
     from the dialog. This forced the Choosefont dialog to initialize to 10
     and limited the selection. The default pointsize changes depending on the
     Large font / Small font Windows selection. It is 8 for large fonts. 
     This caused an error from the ChooseFont dialog since the limits were
     set to 10. Remove forced limits on font size in maxmeter. This results
     in the fonts being set to the default size for the Large/Small selection.
