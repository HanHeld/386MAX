Reduce Disk Activity When Displaying Low DOS Memory

If MAXMETER is displaying low DOS memory through GoAhead, it opens and
closes the driver every time it references the driver which generates
a lot of extra disk activity, especially noticeable if there's no disk
cache.

This TWT fixes that by opening the driver once at the beginning of the
program (in InitInstance), and closes it once (in response to
WM_CLOSE).  The global variable hDriver contains the driver handle.

CVERSION.H	Bump the module version #.

MAXMETER.C	Move the code which opens the driver from
		  InitStatBar() (which is called many times) to
		  InitInstance() which is called once per instance.
		Delete all other references to OpenDriver(), testing
		  the value in hDriver to see if the GoAhead driver is
		  in memory.
		Delete all other references to CloseDriver() except
		  for the one in response to WM_CLOSE.
