* Put libraries in %MAXROOT%lib

Fix file entry:

* Put libraries in %MAXROOT%lib

 Description:
 	This should not affect the product in any way.  The build procedure
	should no longer copy any .lib files down to x:\apps\release\max8
	or wherever the final destination is.
 Who: HENRY
 When: 24 Oct 95.
 SW/HW Environment: All.
 Symptom: Build fails on any module expecting a library in the
	local library dir.  Bob made a recent change to work around
	this, these changes should have all projects in the build
	working the same way.
 Temporary Workaround: NAB.
 Test Procedure: Remove all .LIB files from x:\apps\release\max8
 	and run a build.
 QA Testing Passed:
 Version: Max 8, build 6

New files:

Files affected:

MAX.MAK
	Build DOS versions of expanded C run-time libraries (not currently
	needed as we don't have any DOS apps that use more than 20 file
	handles).

ASQ\MAKEFILE
ASQENG\MAKEFILE
INSTALL\MAKEFILE
MAX\MAKEFILE
MAXIMIZE\MAKEFILE
QUILIB\MAKEFILE
SNAPSHOT\MAKEFILE
	Use %MAXROOT%lib as output for .lib files.  Apps that use them
	need to look in the right place now.

TEXT\TEXT.MAK
	Fix makefile oversight which didn't copy *.xus to *.lst
