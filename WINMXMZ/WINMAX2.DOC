More changes to WinMaxim

Fix file entry:

* More changes to WinMaxim

 Description:
 	Quite a number of feature-type changes and a few bugs
	have been fixed.  As the previous version was fairly
	incomplete, I won't detail the changes here.  Still
	remaining to be fixed are 1. Check Maximize.exe for
	brand 2. Check for Max installed in selected MBoot
	section 3. Hook up actual help (?need contexts).
 Who: HENRY
 When: 25 Oct 95
 SW/HW Environment: Windows.
 Symptom: Varies.
 Temporary Workaround: None.
 Test Procedure: Retest every facet of WinMaxim.
 QA Testing Passed:
 Version: WinMaxim 8.0.11.002

New files:

WINLNCH.C
	Windows launcher.  This 22K-overhead program is needed just
	so we can pass the free DOS memory size up to WinMaxim.  It's
	linked as the DOS stub for WinMaxim, so one could also use
	it to start WinMaxim from DOS.

	When I have time I'll rewrite it in assembler to take up 4-5K.

Files affected:

CVERSION.H
	Bump version to 2

MXDLGS.CPP
MXDLGS.H
	Handle existing USE= / NOROMSRCH / VGASWAP / NOVGASWAP statements.

	Added new disabling checkboxes (for removing previous settings).

	Weed out common and menu sections from MultiConfig selection.

	Center all dialogs.

	Use menu descriptions for MultiConfig (rather than section names).

	Add exit confirmation dialog.

	Add blue background for Maximize summary.

RESOURCE.H
	Added new controls, etc.

SPLASH.CPP
	Center dialog.
	Resize to bitmap size.
	Use BitBlt instead of stretch.

SUMMARY.CPP
SUMMARY.H
	Re-did this per Vic's design.

WINMXMZ.CPP
	Added code to parse MAXIMIZE.CFG, CONFIG.SYS, and 386MAX.PRO (all
	that just to get USE=F??? and VGASWAP).

	Handle new switches for removal.

WINMXMZ.DEF
	Add WinLnch.exe as stub (starts WIN.COM c:\386max\winmaxim.exe ... nnn,
	where nnn is free KB low DOS as if WinLnch was not running).

WINMXMZ.INC
	Update dependencies.

WINMXMZ.MAK
	Increase stack.

	Build WinLnch.exe

WINMXMZ.RC
