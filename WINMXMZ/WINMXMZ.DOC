Add new Windows Maximize program

Fix file entry:

* Add new Windows Maximize program

 Description:
	This program is not in a finished stage but should offer all
	the functionality to be offered in the shipping product.
	Work is needed mostly on visual aspects and on error handling.
 Who: HENRY
 When: 13 Oct 95.
 SW/HW Environment: Starting from Windows or Win95.
 Symptom: NAB.
 Temporary Workaround: Exit Windows and start Maximize from DOS.
	For Win95, use F8 when booting and don't start Windows.
 Test Procedure: Run Custom and Express Maximize from Windows.
	Also test running Maximize from DOS.  Check Autoexec.bat
	carefully for any apparent mishandling (we add a line so
	we can show the summary under Windows).
 QA Testing Passed:
 Version: WinMaxim 8.0.3.001
		  Maximize 8.0.005

New files:
MAXIMIZE
  NEWNAMES.C
	Tool to update source.	Basically just does multiple search
	and replace operations on one or more files (no wildcards,
	sorry).

WINMXMZ
  ALTICON1.ICO
  WINMXMZ.ICO
	Icons.	WINMXMZ.ICO is the default.

  CVERSION.H
	Module version data.

  MXDLGS.CPP
  MXDLGS.H
	Declaration and implementation of MFC dialogs for most of
	the Maximize options.

  PROGDDE.CPP
  PROGDDE.H
	Progman DDE interface stuff for adding things to startup folder.
	We may not need this after all.

  RESOURCE.H
	Resource constants.

  SPLASH.BMP
	A really ugly splash screen.

  SPLASH.H
  SPLASH.CPP
	Declaration and implementation of MFC dialog to display
	splash screen (really just a dialog with a bitmap in it).

  STDAFX.H
  STFAFX.CPP
	Standard precompilation stuff for C8.

  SUMMARY.H
  SUMMARY.CPP
	Declaration and implementation of MFC dialog to display
	results of optimization by getting data from MAXIMIZE.INI.

  WINMXMZ.CPP
  WINMXMZ.H
	Main application class.  Note that everything happens
	via dialogs of one sort or the other.

  WINMXMZ.DEF
	Module definition file for linker.

  WINMXMZ.INC
	Header dependencies.

  WINMXMZ.MAK
	Project makefile.

  WINMXMZ.RC
	AppStudio resource file.

Files affected:

MAX.MAK
	Add new target.  Fix problem with batch file echoing to %MBLDOUT%
	when undefined (causes DOS to complain "unable to create file")

INCLUDE
  COMMDEF.H
	Update header to recognize WINDOWS.H, which has changed since
	the Windows 2.x days.

  COMMFUNC.H
  MBPARSE.H
	Add extern "C" to work with C++ code.

  MVERSION.H
	Hook up _lcldefs.h.  This file defines whether beta numbering
	will be displayed and allows you to specify a unique alpha
	suffix as well.

  TEXTNAME.MAK
	Add new file to distribution.

MAXIMIZE
  BROWSE.C
  COPYFILE.C

  PASS2.C
  PASS3.C
  READCNFG.C
  READMXMZ.C
  REORDER.C
  UTIL.C
  WRFILES3.C
	Updated to work without OLDNAMES.LIB.  This was done using a new
	tool, NEWNAMES.C.  Still experimental and a bit rough - doesn't
	know about comments yet - but does the job.  Backup your source
	before trying NEWNAMES a.c b.c c.c d.c ...

  MAKEFILE
	Get rid of OLDNAMES.LIB

	Tell stupid MS linker not to generate a bad .exe!  Duh!

  MAXIMIZE.C
	Updated to work without OLDNAMES.LIB.
	Handle new /X (from windows) and /P (premaxim and reboot) options.
	These are meant only to support WinMaxim.EXE and so are not
	documented in the /? help.

  MAXSUB.ASM
	Save region sizes before they get blown away by the optimization
	algorithm (actually, they get pared down to what remains).

  MAXVAR.H
	Declare some more UTIL_OPT variables.

	Declare new MAXSUB variables.

	Add flag for FromWindows mode (/X).

  REBOOT.C
	Updated to work without OLDNAMES.LIB.
	Pass FromWindows switch on to next phase.

  SCREENS.C
	Updated to work without OLDNAMES.LIB.
	Remove waits for keystrokes in Phase 3 (/X in effect).
	Write data to Maximize.INI for display of results from Windows.
	Add line before first shell in first startup batch file to
	start Windows and display Maximize results if that's where
	we started from.

  VERSDATA.ASM
	Update copyright messages.
	Change product name to MAX.
