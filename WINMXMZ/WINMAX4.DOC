More Winmaxim changes

Fix file entry:

* More Winmaxim changes

 Description:
 	Some minor changes, as well as a build fix for the 386LOAD version
	(previously only the beta version was generated).  We no longer
	add Winmaxim before QMT without the .exe.  This also fixes the
	problem on some systems where the DOS truename function fails
	under Windows.
 Who: HENRY
 When: 11 Nov 95.
 SW/HW Environment: All.
 Symptom: See WINMAX4.DOC.
 Temporary Workaround: See WINMAX4.DOC.
 Test Procedure: See WINMAX4.DOC
 QA Testing Passed:
 Version: WinMxmz 8.0.31.008; Maximize 8.0.009; 386LOAD, build 31 (no delete
 	needed for retail)

Files affected:


386LOAD\MAKEFILE
	Make 386LOAD version (beta vs. retail, QMax vs. Blue) dependent
	on top-level defines from MAXNAMES.MAK.

INCLUDE\MAXNAMES.MAK
	Define COREEXBASE as REB / RET / BLB / BLU for 386LOAD (beta QMAX /
	retail Qmax / beta BlueMax / retail BlueMax)

MAXIMIZE\SCREENS.C
	When skipping shell programs named QMT or RAMEXAM, ignore extension.
	Previously this worked only with (for example) C:\QMAX\QMT.EXE,
	not with C:\QMAX\QMT

MAXIMIZE\VERSBETA.ASM
	Bump ver to 9.

WINMXMZ\CVERSION.H
	Bump ver to 8.  Note it got double-incremented accidentally.
	No big deal, but this TWT is already logged in (pending corrections
	on review).

WINMXMZ\MXDLGS.CPP
	If no MultiConfig section selected, use a different error message
	rather than say "Invalid section [] - try another"  The [] looks
	funny in Windows.

WINMXMZ\WINMXMZ.CPP
	Remove all TRUENAME calls.  Under certain as-yet-not-fully-determined
	circumstances, the buffer translation for the call is muffed (probably
	by some VxD hooking the call, possibly a network) and the call
	fails though no error is set.

	The only down side of yanking these truename translation calls
	is that startup batch files containing assign and  /or subst
	calls essential to accessing crucial drives and /or directories
	will not be processed properly (only if we need to reboot into
	Maximize and MAX is NOT the currently running memory manager).

WINMXMZ\WINMXMZ.RC
	Add Alt-D accelerator for VGASwap Disable.
