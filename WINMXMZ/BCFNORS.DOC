Disable ROMSrch if BCF or AUTOBCF is present

Fix file entry:

* Disable ROMSrch if BCF or AUTOBCF is present

 Description:
 	If BCF=xxxx or AUTOBCF is present in the MAX profile, we
	disable to "Run ROMSrch" checkbox.   Also, if running
	WinMaxim for the very first time, Run ROMSrch should
	be checked by default (unless USE=fxxx or NOROMSRCH already
	exist).
 Who:	HENRY
 When:	6 Feb 96.
 SW/HW Environment: BCF machines.
 Symptom: User may elect to run ROMSrch, which will refuse to run.
 Temporary Workaround: None.  Don't do that.
 Test Procedure: On a BCF machine, run WinMaxim and verify that
	in the Custom dialog, ROMSrch is completely disabled.
	On a non-BCF machine, remove any USE= statements from
	high DOS, remove any NOROMSRCH statements, and any ROMsrch
	related statements in the QMAX.INI file, and run WINMAXIM.
	Select the Custom dialog and verify that Run Romsrch is
	checked by default.
 QA Testing Passed:
 Version: WinMaxim 8.01.6.010

Files affected:

CVERSION.H
	Bump ver to 10.

MXDLGS.CPP
MXDLGS.H
	Add m_bROMSrchEna switch to allow ROMsrch to be completely
	disabled (if we have a BCF machine).

WINMXMZ.CPP
	Disable ROMSrch if BCF= or AUTOBCF found.

	Make default for ROMSrch TRUE in all cases (Custom as well
	as Express).  Note that selecting Express forces the default
	of ROMSrch on (unless otherwise verboten).
