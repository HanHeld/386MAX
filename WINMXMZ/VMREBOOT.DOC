Handle reboot for Maximize phase I from another memory manager's VM

Fix file entry:

* Handle reboot for Maximize phase I from another memory manager's VM

 Description:
 	We now handle the case where MAX is not active.  Unfortunately
	there's no clean way to distinguish between real mode (just
	HIMEM) and another memory manager from within Windows.  So
	we let Maximize figure out which it is.  This TWT also fixes
	a problem with not being able to view help on the Summary
	dialog.
 Who: HENRY
 When: 11 Nov 95.
 SW/HW Environment: Maximizing a section with MAX installed (possibly
 	the current one) but another memory manager is still active.
 Symptom: Maximize bombs out.
 Temporary Workaround: Reboot before starting Winmaxim.
 Test Procedure: Boot under a Multiconfig section with Himem.
 	Run Winmaxim on a section with MAX installed.  Do the same
	with EMM386, QEMM, and Netroom.
 QA Testing Passed:
 Version: Maximize 8.0.8; Winmaxim 8.0.29.006

New files:

FILECOPY.C
	Ripped off from Dispatch's STATUTIL.  Copies a file.

MESSAGES.H
	Messages and other text for Winmaxim.

Files affected:

MAXIMIZE.C
	Handle new /R switch which:
	1. If system is in real mode, returns an errorlevel 5 for the
	   batch file which invokes Maximize from Windows to recognize
	   and proceed with normal phase 1.
	2. If system is in V86 mode and MAX is not active, reboots.
	   CONFIG.SYS and AUTOEXEC.BAT have already been setup by
	   WINMAXIM at this point.

	Note that all responsibility for setting up and restoring
	system files rests with WINMAXIM and the batch file it
	creates to run Maximize in this special case.

VERSBETA.ASM
	Bumpv er to 8.

SUMMARY.CPP
SUMMARY.H
WINMXMZ.H
	Add code to switch active window to summary dialog.

WINMXMZ.CPP
	Move some messages into MESSAGES.H
	Handle the case where MAX is not active (either real mode w/
	HIMEM or another memory manager).
	Check for errors when trying to Undo via Maximize /X /P

WINMXMZ.INC
	Updated DEPSCAN dependency list.

WINMXMZ.MAK
	Add new file copy module.

WINMXMZ.RC
	Don't make summary dialog system modal.  This forces the user to
	look at it but causes help to not work.

	Now clicking on the background brings the summary to the fore.
