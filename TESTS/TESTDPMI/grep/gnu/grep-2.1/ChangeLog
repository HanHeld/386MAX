	* src/dfa.c (sys/types.h): File included unconditionnaly.

1997-08-16  Eli Zaretskii  <eliz@is.elta.co.il>

	* grep.c (long_options) [O_BINARY]: Add DOS-specific options.
	(fillbuf) [O_BINARY]: For DOS-style text files, strip CR
	characters at end of line.
	(prline) [O_BINARY]: Report correct byte offsets, even though CR
	characters were stripped when reading the file.
	(usage) [O_BINARY]: Add DOS-specific options.
	(setmatcher) [HAVE_SETRLIMIT]: Set re_max_failures so that the
	matcher won't ever overflow the stack.
	(main) [__MSDOS__, _WIN32]: Handle backslashes and drive letters
	in argv[0], remove the .exe suffix, and downcase the prgram name.
	[O_BINARY]: Pass additional DOS-specific options to getopt_long
	and handle them.  Call stat before attempting to open the file, in
	case it is a directory (DOS will fail the open call for
	directories).  Switch the input descriptor to binary mode, unless
	it is a terminal device.

	* system.h [O_BINARY]: Define macros to switch a handle to binary
	mode, so binary files could be grep'ed on MS-DOS and MS-Windows.
	[HAVE_SETLOCALE]: Test for HAVE_SETLOCALE instead of
	HAVE_LC_MESSAGES, to prevent compilation error in grep.c on
	systems which don't define HAVE_LC_MESSAGES, but have setlocale.

	* dosbuf.c: New file, functions specific for MS-DOS/MS-Windows.
	(guess_type, undossify_input, dossified_pos): New functions.

	* djgpp/config.h, djgpp/config.bat, djgpp/main.mak, djgpp/src.mak,
	djgpp/po.mak, djgpp/intl.mak, djgpp/tests.mak, djgpp/po2tbl.sed:
	New files, for building Grep with DJGPP tools for MS-DOS and
	MS-Windows.

	* grep.1: Document DOS-specific switches.

1997-08-08 Alain Magloire

	* grep-2.0e: available for testing

	* grep.c: change LC_MESSAGE to LC_ALL for (LC_CTYPE).
	Suggested by Jochen Hein.

	* ABOUT-NLS: updated.
	* grep.c: --version: more verbosity (COPYRIGHT).
	* grep.c: --help: PATTERN, FILE instead of <pattern>, <file>.
	* INSTALL.grep: not necessary removed.
	* configure.in: --disable-regex rename --without-include-regex.
	* THANKS: format: first row name, second email.
	* ChangeLog: format ISO 8601.
	Reported by Franc,ois Pinard.

	* grep.c: move dcl of struct stat st into "else" where it's used.
	Reported by Jim Meyering.

	* grep.c: totalnl should be %u in printf.
	Reported by Michael Aichlmay
	Corrected with guidance from Ulrich Drepper

1997-07-24 Alain Magloire <alainm@rcsm.ee.mcgill.ca>

	* Makefile.am: corrected an error when installing {f,e}grep.1.
	From Kaveh R. Ghazi <ghazi@caip.rutgers.edu>.
	From Ulrich Drepper <drepper@cygnus.com>.

	* Many files: use PARAMS instead of __STDC__ for prototypes.
	From Jim Meyering <meyering@eng.ascend.com>.
	Patch provided by Kaveh R. Ghazi <ghazi@caip.rutgers.edu>.

	* dfa.[ch]: uses the one in gawk-3.0.3 with the patch from
	Arnold (see Changelog: July 12 1997)

	* grep.1: a note to say -l, -L, -q stop on first match.
	Noted by Andrew Beattie <gaffer@tug.com>.

	* grep.c: refuse to scan if the file is a directory.
	This was causing problems on SUNs. If the directory contains
	a file that could match the pattern, garbage was display.

	* tests directory: added new set of tests from Henry Spencer
	regex package. Change the way the tests were done to be more
	conformant to automake.

	* configure.in: added --disable-regex for folks with their own fuctions.

	* grep-20d : available for testing

1997-07-18 Alain Magloire <alainm@rcsm.ee.mcgill.ca>

1997-07-17 Alain Magloire <alainm@rcsm.ee.mcgill.ca>

	* src/grep.c: Cause grep to fail if `fclose (stdout)' fails.
	From Jim Meyering <meyering@eng.ascend.com>.	

	* grep.c:usage() more consistency in the --help.

	* egrep, fgrep were links This is in violation of GNU standards:
	"Please don't make the behavior of a utility depend on the name used
	to invoke it.  It is useful sometimes to make a link to a utility with
	a different name, and that should not change what it does."
	For now egrep and fgrep will be copies of grep. A better scheme
	should be found later.
	After discussion with Tom Tromey <tromey@cygnus.com>.

	* fgrep.man and egrep.man included: They are stubs that call grep.1.
	* Makefile.am: modified to install {f,e,}grep[,.1].

	* speed hack for -l, -L: bail out on first match.
	From Scott Weikart <scott@igc.apc.org>.

	* *.[ch]: provided prototypes for strict argument checking
	With the help of Stewart Levin <stew@sep.stanford.edu>.
