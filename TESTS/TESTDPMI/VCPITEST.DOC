VCPITEST -- VCPI Test Program

This primitive program tests each VCPI call to an EMS emulator at
least once.

The source module VCP_EPM.ASM contains code to exercise the VCPI
debugger interface.  If one is present, the VCPITEST program calls the
single-step interrupt handler (INT 01h).  At that point you can
single-step through the code.


Comments on Debugger
--------------------

The file 386SWAT.DOC describes the (internal tool) debugger.  Press
F1 to see a help screen.  Briefly, press the Grey-plus to single-step,
and the Grey-minus key to single-skip over the next instruction
(typically a CALL or LOOP).  To continue running, press Esc.

Please let me know whether it is worthwhile to continue to develop an
interface between VCPI and a debugger such as this.

Finally, this debugger is an internal tool used within Qualitas.
Please don't distribute it any further.
