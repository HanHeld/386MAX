Make VCPITEST work with EMS=0

In order to test MEMLIMIT changes, I needed to get VCPITEST
working using back door VCPI services.

Files affected:

GETBCRC.ASM	Updated copyright date.
L2PTEST.ASM
VCP_ARGS.ASM
VCP_PHYS.ASM

MAKEFILE	Update dependencies and use RET directory for output files.

VCP_DBG.ASM	Use back door macro.
VCP_IBV.ASM
VCP_MEM.ASM

VCP_EPM.ASM	Use back door except when we're checking for a VCPI
		debugger (well, SWAT) in which case we need to install
		a temporary Int 67h handler.

VCP_FLAG.INC	Define flag to use back door only (in case it's an older
		version of MAX with EMS=0).

		Define macro to use back door if MAX is the VCPI host.

VCP_MISC.ASM	Check for different VCPI host IOCTL names which might
		be present when no EMS services are provided.  If MAX,
		get PORT67 for back door VCPI services.

VCP_TEST.INC	Add PVCS header.
VERSION.ASM

VCPITEST.ASM	Update copyright dates and use back door macro.
