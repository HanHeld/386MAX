Handle missing AUTOEXEC.BAT and QEMM 8 syntax in STRIPMGR

* Handle missing AUTOEXEC.BAT and QEMM 8 syntax in STRIPMGR

 Description:
 	If there is no AUTOEXEC.BAT, or if another startup
	batch file is specified but does not exist, STRIPMGR
	now quietly ignores it and pretends everything's OK.
	Also, STRIPMGR now handles some syntax new to QEMM 8
	which we did not properly strip before.
 Who: HENRY
 When: 1 Feb 96
 SW/HW Environment: 1. No AUTOEXEC.BAT (more likely in Win95).
 	2. QEMM 8 LOADHI (uses /switch=value /switch2=value progname)
 Symptom: 1. STRIPMGR says "Insert disk with "" and press any key"
 	This may not be apparent when run from SETUP as a PIF.
	2. Line is changed from device=loadhi /foo=bar setver.exe
	to device==bar setver.exe
 Temporary Workaround: 1. Create an empty AUTOEXEC.BAT.  2. None
 	(remove manually).
 Test Procedure: Rename AUTOEXEC.BAT and run STRIPMGR /S.  It should
 	not complain about the missing AUTOEXEC.  Also verify that
	QEMM 8, MemMaker LOADHIGH / DEVICEHIGH, and 386LOAD syntax
	is all stripped correctly.  A simple way to do this is to
	edit STRIPMGR.LST and add the appropriate lines under MAX.
 QA Testing Passed:
 Version: STRIPMGR 1.40, Max 8.01 build 004


Files affected:

MESSAGE.H
	Update copyrights, bump ver.

MISC.C
	Add new flag to remove_switches().  If non-zero, keep our
	old behavior of stripping all switch text until we find =.
	If 0, strip all switch text, ignoring =.

PARSER.C
	Test for existence of AUTOEXEC.BAT.  If missing, ignore it.
	Everything put inside the if (!_access()) { } was indented
	so I used the vdiff -b option.

	Add comments noting subtle change in behavior of ~ flag.
	The # flag does the same as always with DEVICEHIGH, but
	~ now causes all switches to be stripped up to the next
	whitespace.

	Change calls to remove_switches.

STRIPMGR.H
	Change declaration of remove_switches().
