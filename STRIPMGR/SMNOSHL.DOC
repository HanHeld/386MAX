* Fix old STRIPMGR bug with no SHELL= statement in CONFIG.SYS

 Description:
 	If CONFIG.SYS has no SHELL= statement (or if MultiConfig,
	the active section has no SHELL= statement) STRIPMGR (since
	about version 6.03) would fail to process AUTOEXEC.BAT.
 Who: HENRY
 When: 13 Nov 95.
 SW/HW Environment: No SHELL= statement in CONFIG.SYS (or none
	in active part of CONFIG.SYS).
 Symptom: AUTOEXEC.BAT is not processed at all.
 Temporary Workaround: Add SHELL=c:\dos\command.com /e:256 /p
 	to CONFIG.SYS.
 Test Procedure: REM any SHELL= statement from CONFIG.SYS and
 	run STRIPMGR /S with at least one 386LOAD / LOADHI statement
	in AUTOEXEC.BAT.  Verify that statements are properly stripped
	from AUTOEXEC.BAT.  Try this in a MultiConfig environment
	also where there are SHELL= statements in CONFIG.SYS but none
	in the active section.
 QA Testing Passed:
 Version: STRIPMGR 1.39

Files affected:

MESSAGE.H
	Bump version to 1.39.

PARSER.C
	If no SHELL= statements found, use default of d:\autoexec.bat
	(where d: is the boot drive).
