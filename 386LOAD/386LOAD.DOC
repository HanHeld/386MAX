; The format is case-insensitive, free-form, one line per item.
; Each line is defined as follows:

; Flags Filename.Ext DATE [optional [optional2]]

; where Flags must be one or more of
; A = Force low load at all times (AUTOEXEC.BAT and children)
; Bn = Apply rule #n where
;      0 = Disallow split allocation; force all allocations for this
;	   program to come out of the largest high DOS region if loading
;	   itself high via 4B. (date ignored)
;      1 = Close off low DOS when loading this program high via 386LOAD
;      2 = Close high DOS when loading this device high via 386LOAD.SYS
;      3 = If GETSIZE, hook INT 2Fh/4A11/FFFC and tell appropriate lies
; C = Use COM file stack processing for EXE file; if [optional] is
;     specified, it contains the minimum size of hole to skip in bytes
; D = Use top of region as INT 12h value during init (Device Drivers only)
; E = Force ENVSAVE
; Fn = Apply fix #n when file is loaded:
;      0 = kill test for >= A000 (Mitsumi CD-ROM drivers)
; G = Force low load at all times (CONFIG.SYS only)
; Hn = Add [optional] decimal value in bytes:
;      0 = to initialization value
;      1 = to resident value only when GETSIZE is in effect.  If [optional2]
;      is specified, add it to initialization value when GETSIZE is in effect.
;      2 = Ignore optional values, but force NETX rounding of initialization
;      sizes (next 256 byte boundary + 256 bytes).
; I = Force instancing
; K = Disable stacks for this program
; L = Force low load if busmaster present
; Mn = Apply rule #n (date ignored) where
;      0 = Lie to this program about start of high DOS
;      1 = Return physical address for XMS Lock XMB calls
;      2 = Don't provide XMS UMBs (use 5800 support instead)
;      3 = Disable 5800 support when this program loads
; N = Force NORETRY
; P = Force recognition of PROTMAN$ driver
; S = Force GETSIZE value; [optional] has the value
;     and consists of decimal limit in bytes
; T = TOPFILL limit for GETSIZE; [optional] has the value
;     and consists of decimal limit in KB (e.g. 512)
; Un = Enforce DPMI rule #n where
;      1 = Enforce DPMI descriptor usage rules
;      2 = Disallow Mouse Event Interrupts if in DOS and swapping is active
;      3 = Zero demand-allocated pages
;      4 = Limit lockable page count to 15MB
;      5 = Lie about DPMI version # (say it's 0.90)
;      6 = Skip swapfile for this DPMI client
;      7 = Lie about availability of DPMI services to this client
; X = Don't allow program to 4B00/4B01 into high DOS

; Filename.ext consists of the entire filename, including the extension
; and DATE, and is in the form YY/MM/DD or YY-MM-DD.  Use 00/00/00 if the
; flags apply to all versions of the file.

; Note that the A and G flags are used only by MAXIMIZE.  The M, I and X
; flags are read in only when 386MAX.SYS initializes.  Dates specified
; for the M and X flags are ignored.

; See 386LOAD.CFG for the actual configuration data
