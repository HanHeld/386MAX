Merge BCF Files Into DISK Generation

Now that we've merged BlueMAX into Qualitas MAX, we need to generate
the disks with BCF files.  These files are put into a separate
subdirectory called BCF\ on disk #2.

DISK.MAK	Define BCF= path from which BCF files are copied.
		Everywhere $(D2) is mentioned, also take suitable
		  action on $(D2)\BCF.
