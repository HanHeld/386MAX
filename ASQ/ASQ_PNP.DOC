Add Plug and Play detection to ASQ

Fix file entry:

* Add Plug and Play detection to ASQ

 Description:
 	ASQ now reports on Plug and Play devices (using a new text
	file PNP.TXT to get the names) as well as PCI systems and
	CD-ROM drives.  A bug in reporting environment in high DOS
	has also been fixed.  If no mouse driver is installed, we
	now report on the pointing device bit in equipment flags.
	There's a BIOS call to check for a PS/2 mouse, but it's
	unsafe to call as ROMSRCH has not been exercising it unless
	a mouse driver was present.  CPU speed reporting has been
	updated and now displays CPUID information (family, model,
	and stepping).
 Who: HENRY
 When: 1 Feb 96
 SW/HW Environment: Plug and Play machines, PCI machines, any
 	machine with one or more CD-ROM drives, any machine with
	a PS/2 mouse (i.e. hooked up to the motherboard), and
	any machine with the master environment loaded high (via
	ExtraDOS).
 Symptom: Most of these are not bugs.  If the master environment
	is loaded high it may be garbage.  If no mouse driver is
	present we say a mouse is "not installed" which is not
	true.
 Temporary Workaround: None.
 Test Procedure: Run ASQ on any combination of machines mentioned
 	under Environment.  Verify that CPU speed is reported
	correctly, genuine Intel processors are reported correctly,
	CPUID family (the first number, a 4, 5, or 6) makes sense,
	CD-ROM drives make sense (none reported unless MSCDEX is
	loaded), PCI machines are detected, and Plug and Play
	device information makes sense.
 QA Testing Passed:
 Version: ASQ 8.01.002 (MAX 8.01, build 004)

New files:

ASQENG\ASQENG.INC
	Depscan-generated dependencies.

ASQENG\BUSINFO.ASM
	New file with Plug and Play and PCI detection.

ASQENG\BUSINFO.H
	Declarations for BUSINFO.ASM.

INCLUDE\PNP.H
	Plug and Play structures and prototypes.  This was originally
	meant to be a dual-use MASM and C file, but I only partly did
	the MASM part.

TEXT\PNP.TXT
	Plug and Play IDs for display in ASQ.

Files affected:

ASQ\AHELP.C
	CPUPARM structure is now nested within ENGREPORT.

ASQ\ASQTEXT.H
	Add "Evaluating..." messages for Plug and Play and CD-ROM.

ASQ\VERSBETA.ASM
	Bump version to 2.

ASQENG\ADF.H
	Change #include quotes to angle brackets so depscan doesn't whine.

ASQENG\BIOSID.H
	Add warning comment for structure.

	Add comment documenting flag reserved for PCI BIOS.

ASQENG\CFG_INFO.H
ASQENG\DEVICE.H
ASQENG\HDW_INFO.H
ASQENG\INFO.H
ASQENG\MAPINFO.H
ASQENG\MEM_INFO.H
ASQENG\QTAS.H
ASQENG\SYSBUF.H
INCLUDE\LIBCOLOR.H
INCLUDE\LISTLIST.H
INCLUDE\MENU.H
INCLUDE\QWINDOWS.H
	More quotes to angle brackets.

ASQENG\CPUTEXT.C
	Pass CPUPARM pointer so we can get Intel flag.  Pentium is a
	trademarked name (as is Pentium Pro) so we use 80586 and 80686
	if a non-Intel processor.

ASQENG\ENGINE.C
	Copy entire CPUPARM member to ENGREPORT (as we need the Intel
	flag and other tidbits).

ASQENG\ENGTEXT.H
	Add new strings.
	Change non-BIOS disk message to something more sensible.

ASQENG\HDW_INFO.C
	Display Plug and Play data.

	Handle Pentium Pro CPU.

	Display CPUID family, model and stepping.

	Display PCI version.

	Display CD-ROM drives in use.

	NOTE: There are some strings in here I missed moving to the .H file.
	I'll have to get those in a later TWT.

ASQENG\MAKEFILE
	Set up to use ASQENG.INC (Depscan-generated dependencies).

ASQENG\MULTIME.ASM
	Use a prime number with a random pattern of bits set to
	avoid any potential multiply optimizations.

ASQENG\READSYS.C
	Read snapshot PCI, Plug and Play, CD-ROM, and additional CPU info.
	Note that we still read older snapshots.

ASQENG\SYSINFO.C
	Get Plug and Play and CD-ROM data.

	Detect PCI.

	If no mouse driver, check equipment flag for pointing device.

	Fix bug with not reporting environment in high DOS.

	Update CPU speed reporting to handle P4X, P54C, and Pentium Pro
	devices and to round others off to reasonable values.

	Read PNP device descriptions into memory.  Since PNP.TXT is easily
	user-customizable, we save these values into the snapshot.

	Add code to detect MSCDEX and CD-ROMs.

ASQENG\SYSINFO.H
	Add PCI and Plug and Play flags.

	Add new members for PnP, CD-ROM, and PCI.

ASQENG\SYSTEXT.H
	Add new snapshot tokens and keywords.  These don't get translated.

ASQENG\WRITSYS.C
	Write new data to snapshot.

DISK\DISK.MAK
	Strip symbols from SETUP.EXE and SETUPDOS.OVL.

	Add option to MAKEDISK.BAT to allow a directory to be specified.

INC\CPUFET.INC
	Document Pentium Pro bits.

	Add bitmasks in hex.

INCLUDE\CPU.H
	Add additional data (all from CPUID) to CPUPARM structure.

INCLUDE\CPUCODES.INC
	Add new value for Pentium Pro.

INCLUDE\CPUTEXT.H
	Add new value for P6, also changed cpu_textof to take a CPUPARM *.

INCLUDE\ENGINE.H
	Change CPUPARM data in ENGREPORT to nested CPUPARM.

INCLUDE\LIBTEXT.H
	Update copyright, fix INSTALL -> SETUP.

INCLUDE\MVERSION.H
	Bump version to 8.01 (for Windows apps), update copyright year.

INCLUDE\TEXTNAME.MAK
	Add new file PNP.TXT to build.

MAXHELP\MAXHELP.MAK
	Fix problem with compiling help.

QUILIB\CPU.ASM
	Save CPUID data in CPUPARM structure.
