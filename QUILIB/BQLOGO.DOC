Build QLOGO data from source

Fix file entry:

* Build QLOGO data from source

 Description:
 	Recent changes introduced an umlaut (u with two dots) into the
	string displayed during the Q or ASQ logos.  To accommodate this
	and simplify any future changes in these logos (none anticipated,
	but this was mainly required for these apparently simple changes)
	QLOGO.OVL is now built from MASM source.  Binary constants provide
	a way to visually manipulate the characters to be downloaded.
 Who: HENRY
 When: 4 Mar 96.
 SW/HW Environment: DOS (not under Windows), VGA.
 Symptom: International characters display as graphics.
 Temporary Workaround: None.
 Test Procedure: Use the following alt- characters beside their non-
 	diacritical counterparts in branding the product:
	Åu (129), Ña (132), éA (142), îo (148), ôO (153), öU (154),
	§n (164), ‡ (224), · (225).  Verify that they all look OK both
	in MAX shell (max /e) and in asq.  To freeze these screens bring
	up SWAT and use F10 to view the underlying screen.
 QA Testing Passed:
 Version: Max 8.01 German, post-CeBit edition.

New files:

QUILIB\LOGOAVAI.TXT
	Document characters used (and available) in the logo building.
	Note that different characters must be used for each (the total
	required is 170 between both logos, so we must define a different
	mapping for each).

QUILIB\QLOGO.ASM
	Simple MASM source to build QLOGO.OVL data.

QUILIB\QLOGO_Q.INC
	Data statements for "Q" logo.

QUILIB\QLOGOASQ.INC
	Data statements for "ASQ" logo.

QUILIB\QLOGOGEN.C
	Source for quick and dirty program to generate .INC files from
	QLOGO.OVL.


Files affected:

TEXT\TEXT.MAK
	Remove implicit rules for copying .OVL files.  QLOGO.OVL should
	eventually be deleted from all machines, but for now it can do
	no harm as the newer one will always be newer.

QUILIB\MAKEFILE
	Add QLOGO.OVL build and copy to list of ALL targets.
