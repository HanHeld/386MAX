Add code to get BIOS data and CRC under Windows

Fix file entry:

* Add code to get BIOS data and CRC under Windows

 Description:
 	This new code allows the Windows SETUP.EXE for MAX 8
	to determine whether the machine supports BIOS compression
	and if so, what is the BIOS CRC.
 Who: HENRY
 When: 28 Dec 95.
 SW/HW Environment: Any MicroChannel machine or IBM 386 or
 	higher.
 Symptom: NAB
 Temporary Workaround: NAB
 Test Procedure: Run DPMICTST.EXE on various machines:
 	1. Non-IBM, non-MCA
	2. Non-IBM MCA
	3. IBM non-MCA
	4. IBM MCA
 QA Testing Passed:
 Version: Max 8.01, build 2

New files:

QUILIB\DPMI_CRC.ASM
	Calculation of BIOS CRC under Windows using DPMI calls.
	Note that we rely on Windows using a magic offset number
	for physical to linear mapping.  We can't use the 0800h
	call for addresses under 1MB.

	Duplicate some other detection code that uses segment
	values so it will work under Windows.

QUILIB\DPMICTST.CPP
	Test program for DPMI_CRC.ASM.

QUILIB\DPMICTST.DEF
	Linker definitions for DPMICTST

QUILIB\DPMICTST.MAK
	Makefile for DPMICTST

Files affected:

INCLUDE\BIOSCRC.H
	Make everything extern "C" if C++

	Add prototypes for new DPMI_* functions.

QUILIB\MAKEFILE
	Add new module to library.

QUILIB\TRUENAME.C
	Add warning comments to code that sometimes doesn't work (apparently
	due to a misbehaving VxD).

WINMXMZ\MYEXECV.ASM
	Fix (rather serious) bug in exec overlay code that didn't
	heed the undocumented warning that the create PSP call
	must be made from CS = PSP segment to copy.
