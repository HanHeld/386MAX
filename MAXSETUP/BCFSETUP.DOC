Add BCF support to SETUP.EXE

Fix file entry:

* Add BCF support to SETUP.EXE

 Description:
	SETUP.EXE now recognizes and extracts the appropriate BCF file.
	The previous behaviors of 1) always removing and re-inserting
	386MAX.SYS and 2) always stripping all 386LOAD lines have been
	removed.  We will only strip other memory managers' load high
	lines.  We also now insert ourselves when there are no other
	DEVICE= lines in CONFIG.SYS (as may be the case with Win95).
 Who: HENRY
 When: 4 Jan 96.
 SW/HW Environment: All; machines supporting BIOS compression.
 Symptom: All 386LOAD statements are stripped; 386MAX.SYS is removed
	then re-added to CONFIG.SYS if it already exists.
 Temporary Workaround: None.
 Test Procedure: On a system with an existing 386MAX.SYS or BlueMAX.SYS
 	(test with both) make sure another device driver is present before
	MAX.  Verify that SETUP doesn't relocate 386MAX.SYS.  In the BlueMAX
	case Bluemax.sys should be changed to 386max.sys.  The existing
	profile should always be recognized.  Run SETUP on machine(s)
	supporting BIOS compression and verify that the correct BCF is
	extracted, in Windows 3.1x, Win95, and with other memory managers.
	Test problems with and without MultiConfig (make sure the MultiConfig
	environment is complex).
 QA Testing Passed:
 Version: SETUP 8.01.2.017

New files:

Files affected:

MAX.MAK
	Add RAMBASIC to normal distribution.

	Note dependency of SETUP on QUILIB (for DPMI_CRC).

INCLUDE\MAXNAMES.MAK
	Bump version number used for volume label.

	Define a default BCF directory (not used other than for
	DISK.MAK, where it is explicitly defined).

INCLUDE\TEXTNAME.MAK
	Turn on BlueMAX compilation.

	Define list of BCF files.  This is not currently used; whatever
	is copied to x:\apps\bcf\*.bcf will be distributed.

MAXSETUP\CVERSION.H
	Bump version to 17.

MAXSETUP\EXTRACT.C
	Extract BCF file.

MAXSETUP\MESSAGES.H
	More messages moved out of source files.

MAXSETUP\MISC.C
	Call new DPMI_ functions for BIOS CRC and other info.

MAXSETUP\SETUP.C
	Add PVCS $Header$

	Fix angle brackets on path include (only locals should have quotes).

	Only STRIPMGR other memory managers.

	Add AUTOBCF if BCF file is found.

	Since we're no longer always stripping ourselves from CONFIG.SYS,
	we need only add ourselves if we weren't there.  If Bluemax.sys was
	previously there, we need to replace the line.

	Recognize previously existing max.sys line in [common] section.

	If previous 386MAX or BLUEMAX found, save name to not strip.
	Also save line number of BLUEMAX.SYS line so we can replace it.

	Support replacing a specified line number in InsertInConfigSys.

	Add lots of FIXMEs (just the tip of the iceberg).

	Handle case where we find no DEVICE= to add ourselves before.

	Handle DEVICEHIGH as well as DEVICE=

	Fix call to ParseInstallCfg(), which never compared the right
	argument.

	Read the correct file in ParseInstallCfg(), and note that we need
	not re-read the entire damn file for every DEVICE= we might skip.
	This is not a big issue as it's unlikely we'll find more than one
	file to skip.

MAXSETUP\SETUP.INC
	Check for dependencies.

MAXSETUP\SETUP.MAK
	Add QUILIB for DPMI_ functions.

MAXSETUP\SETUP.RC
	Use angle brackets for include in search path.
