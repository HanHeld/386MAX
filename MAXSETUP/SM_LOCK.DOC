* Check Usage count on Stripmgr.exe and continue when it's done.

 Description: (1) Stripmgr runs so fast on some systems that it finishes
     before the toolhelp.dll notify callback set to trap completion is
     installed. It then gets installed and waits forever for the notification.
     (2) It was decided for now to simply trap the "Sharing error", which seems
     to occur on re-installs, and rely on the error messages in our programs
     if a real error occurs. (3) Increased serial number buffer in setup to
     allow for storage and retrieval of serial numbers with a few spaces.
 
 Who: PETERJ
 When: 8 Nov. 95
 SW/HW Environment: Windows.
 Symptom: (1) Setup freezes on "Removing memory managers from Autoexec.bat 
          and config.sys" dialog. (2) "Sharing error on drive c:" error
          during install or uninstall. (3) Serial number truncation when
          numbers are stored with spaces.
 Temporary Workaround: None
 Test Procedure: (1) On a system where previous versions failed, install
     Max 8. (2) Install, re-install, uninstall. Watch for the errors.
     (3) Input serial numbers with spaces, as 800 1010 200 80. On re-install,
     watch numbers in registration box.
 QA Testing Passed:
 Version: Setup.exe 8.0.024.011, toolbox.exe 8.0.024.007 

Files affected:

MAXSETUP\SETUP.C        Call GetModuleUsage() as a backup to determine 
                        when Stripmgr has completed. Increased serial number
                        buffer and read length.

MAXSETUP\EXTRACT.C      Call SetErrorMode() around the file extraction to
                        trap Windows' error box.

MAXSETUP\CVERSION.H     Bump version to 11.

MAXCTRL\TOOLBOX.C       Call SetErrorMode() around the file extraction to
                        trap Windows' error box.

MAXCTRL\CVERSION.H      Bump version to 7.
