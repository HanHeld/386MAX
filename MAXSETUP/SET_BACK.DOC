* Setup.exe - Fix backup routines to only backup when not identical d/t.

 Description: Changed the backup scheme in the Windows Setup program so 
     that only files with the same name but a different date and time are 
     moved to the backup directory. Directories with sequential extensions
     are created in the event of multiple install instances. Also moved
     some additional strings to the messages.h file for translation.
