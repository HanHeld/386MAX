* Post-8.0 ( d-id 330 ) Add fonts to Maxmeter ( 486 ) Fix Sharing Error.

 Description: ( d-id 330 ) Add the capability to select fonts to Maxmeter.
              ( d-id 486 ) Fix Setup sharing violation. There was no test
              around the code copying goahead.drv or version checking 
              ctl3dv2.dll. I added a test requiring program installation be
              enabled (checked) before the copying takes place. This will
              still not eliminate the problem on 8.1 upgrades caused by
              GoAhead running or by another program having ctl3dv2.dll loaded
              at install time.
 Who: PETERJ
 When: 21 Nov. 95
 SW/HW Environment: Windows.
 Symptom: (330) No font selection. 
          (486) Sharing error when Setup is run from hard drive after initial
          installation, when GoAhead or other ctl3dv2 programs are active.
 Temporary Workaround: (330) None. (486) Unload all other programs and 
          GoAhead.drv before attempting to run Setup.exe.
 Test Procedure: (330) try different fonts with Maxmeter.
                 (486) Run setup from the program group after installation.
                       Un-check Add Programs. Continue and watch for Sharing
                       violaion errors.
