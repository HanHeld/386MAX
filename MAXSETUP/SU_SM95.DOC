* Add stripm95.pif to turn DOSMAX on in Win95.

 Description: Add stripm95.pif to set DOSMAX=ON in Win95. This prevents
              a bug in the 386max.vxd from generating a page fault. The
              bug has been fixed, but it will trigger in previous versions
              during setup if DOSMAX is off.
