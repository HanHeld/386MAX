* SETUP.EXE - Sharing violation code. Strip Strings.

 Description: Implement a scheme to get around Windows not allowing
     updates to files while they are in use. We make a temp directory
     under the \qmax directory and put the files there, along with a
     batch file to copy them to the proper place. We then extract a
     DOS program, CLEAN.EXE, stored in Setup.exe as a resource, load
     Setup.exe into the startup group with a /C parameter ( to continue),
     call ExitWindowsExec which execs CLEAN.EXE, which runs the batch
     file, removes the directory and removes itself. Control returns to
     Windows and Setup is run. Setup continues at the "Maximize?" dialog.
     I also extracted all strings to a messages.h file for later translation. 

 Who: PETERJ
 When: 13 Dec. 95
 SW/HW Environment: Windows
 Symptom: Sharing Violation crash when updating Max 8.0. Usually caused by
          trying to copy over CTL3DV2.DLL or GOAHEAD.DRV while they are active.
 Temporary Workaround: Hand copy from DOS.
 Test Procedure: Tricky. Install newer versions of CTL3DV2.DLL or GOAHEAD.DRV
          over older copies. You may need to change the version numbers in the
          DLL in order to test the version updating.   
 QA Testing Passed:
 Version: 8.0.37.16

New files:

CLEAN.C                 DOS program to copy Windows files.

MESSAGES.H              Text strings from Setup moved to one location.

EXTFILE.C               File resource extractor, stolen from Dispatch.

EXTFILE.H               Header for file resource extractor.

Files affected:

SETUP.C                 Added code to call ExitWindowsExec for Clean.exe.

                        Added re-entry code to WinExec WinMaxim.exe on return.

                        Get version before calling VerInstallFile because it
                        might not be necessary and VerInstallFile fails if 
                        the file is locked.

                        Stripped strings to messages.h

EXTRACT.C               Added functions to make a copy directory, extract
                        clean.exe from a resource and to create a batch 
                        file to copy and delete files. 

                        Stripped strings to messages.h

SETUP.H                 Added function prototypes.

SETUP.RC                Added new "Must Restart" dialog.

SETUP.MAK               Added build clean.exe.

CVERSION.H              Bump version to 16
