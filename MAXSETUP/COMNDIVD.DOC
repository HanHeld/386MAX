* Add subroutines from Install.exe to Setup.exe to parse config.sys

 Description: Add subroutines from Install.exe to Setup.exe to parse 
     config.sys and divide drivers in the common section into multi-config
     sections so that they may be individually maximized. Also make startup
     group if it does not exist, and provide for the German "Autostart" 
     instead of "Startup".

 Who: PETERJ
 When: 25 Jan. 95
 SW/HW Environment: Windows.
 Symptom: (1) setup.exe does not behave like install.
          (2) Cannot put GoAhead and MaxMeter in startup if it does not exist.
          (3) Ditto, if it is named Autostart.
 Temporary Workaround: Manual editing.
 Test Procedure: (1) Run Setup and verify proper behavior in editing config.sys.
                 (2) delete startup group and run setup. Verify that a startup
                     group is created and that Goahead and Maxmeter get put in.
                 (3) Run the German version of Windows and Run Setup. Goahead
                     and Maxmeter should be put into Autostart.
 QA Testing Passed:
 Version: Setup.exe 8.01.4.20

New files:

MULTI.C             Driver and routines from Install to edit config.sys.

MULTICOM.H          Globals needed for multi.c, from common.h in \install.

Files affected:

SETUP.C             Remove old config.sys editing code and call MultiCfgEdit().
                    Change ShowGroup DDE call to CreateGroup in some cases.
                    Determine name of Strtup group by country code.

SETUPDIF.C          Change added to _added to avoid redefinition error.

SETUP.DEF           Lower heap size to avoid > 64K complaint.

CVERSION.H          Bump version to 20.

SETUP.RC            Change copyright.

SETUP.INC           Add new deps.

SETUP.MAK           Remove /Zp1 from compile switches. Quilib is not packed.
                    Add quilib.lib and oldnames.lib.
