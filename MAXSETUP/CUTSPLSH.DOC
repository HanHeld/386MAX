*  Trim splash screen and remove clipping from setup.exe.

 Description: The qmax.bmp had ragged right and bottom edges. Rex was
     apparently clipping these off in the BitBlt function. I trimmed
     the bitmap edges. This plus the setup clipping resulted in the
     bitmap edges being clipped off in setup. I removed the reduction in
     the BitBlt call. This makes Setup.exe and Winmaxim.exe splash screens
     uniform.

 Who: PETERJ    
 When: 31 Oct. 95   
 SW/HW Environment: Windows.
 Symptom: Splash screen on Winmaxim.exe has white tab on right and bottom.
          Correcting this made bitmap clip on setup.exe.
 Temporary Workaround: none
 Test Procedure: Run setup and winmaxim. Observe splash screens.
 QA Testing Passed:
 Version: Setup 8.000.017.007

Files affected:

SETUP.C                     Increase window size and eliminate -8 clipping.

CVERSION.H                  bump version to 7.
