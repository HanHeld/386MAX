* Fix call to stripmgr and uninitialized pointer in setup.exe

 Description: (1) The parameters were presented in the wrong order in
         the call to stripmgr. (2) An uninitialized pointer in the space
         calculation caused the 386max.sys line to be trashed sometimes.
         
 Who: PETERJ
 When: 5 Feb. 1996
 SW/HW Environment: Windows
 Symptom: (1) Stripmgr removed pre-existing 386max.sys lines in config.sys.
          (2) Trash was written when 386max.sys was inserted at the end
          of config.sys.  
 Temporary Workaround: Manual edit.
 Test Procedure: (1) Install 386max over bluemax. Check config.sys.
                 (2) Install 386MAX over Himem w. no multiconfig, no drivers.
                     Check config.sys.   
 QA Testing Passed:
 Version: Setup 8.01.5.25

Files affected:

SETUP.C             Change parameter order in stripmgr call.
