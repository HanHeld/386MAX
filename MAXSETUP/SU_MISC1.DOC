 Who: PETERJ
 When: 31 Jan. 1996
 SW/HW Environment: Windows.
 Symptom: (1) Goahead can't load driver if it was not installed.
          (2) USE=conflicts with AUTOBCF.
          (3) Possibililty of "Too many files" error. Files not copied.
          (4) Hot keys don't work on UpdateError dialog.
          (5) Cannot retrieve country code for Germany.
          (6) The setup files and GoAhead.drv were not put in OLDMAX.1  
 
 Temporary Workaround:
          (1) Restart Windows.
          (2) Manual edit of 386max.pro to remove USE= statements.
          (3) Close all other programs before installation.
          (4) Use mouse.
          (5) None.
          (6) Manual backup before install.
          
 Test Procedure:  (1) Install with GoAhead running and not running. 
                      The state of GoAhead should be the same as when
                      the installation began.   
                  (2) Install into a BCF system with USE= statements in 
                      386max.pro. Setup should remove these statements.
                  (3) Install and ensure all files are copied.
                  (4) Install Update version on a clean system (no MAX)
                      Check hot keys on update error dialog.
                  (5) Test on German version of Windows for proper installation
                      into Autostart group ( instead of Startup ).
                  (6) Install over 8.0 and ensure that the setup files and
                      Goahead.drv are put into oldmax.1.
