 Who: PETERJ
 When: 8 Feb. 1996
 SW/HW Environment: Windows.
 Symptom: (1) LOADHIGH not being stripped from Autoexec.bat.
          (2) 386max.pro changes not saved to profile.add.
          (3) "System Error - Drive not ready" appears before our reference
              disk warning if disk is nott installed.  
 Temporary Workaround: Manual strip.
 Test Procedure: (1) Test setup.exe on every type of configuration for 
     Autoexec.bat and config.sys. Ensure that lines are stripped properly. 
     (2) Install on new system. Save changes to .add files. Verify the 
     changes are saved and old 386max.pro is restored.
     (3) Install on Microchannel system and don;t insert ref. disk. You
     should only get our warning box.
