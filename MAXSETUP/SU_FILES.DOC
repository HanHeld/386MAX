* Fix bugs in 386max.pro updating and change display. 

 Description:  (1) Move bluemax strip code to after save old. (2) Alter 
     ModifyMaxPro to deal with multiple sections in 386max.pro with 
     the same name. (3) Alter ModifyMaxPro to deal with partial matches, 
     to remove fields with numeric trailers (i.e. FRAME=E000 ). (4)
     Change File read to size of file only. (5) Arrange for one more 
     call to Resync() after end of old file in Diff(), to catch adds at
     the end of file 1.
