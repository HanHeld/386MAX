Fix Bug If ExtraDOS Allocates All But One Para From Region

When ExtraDOS allocates memory from a high DOS region and it would
leave just one para, it fails to cover that one para with a MAC entry.

The allocation is always from a region of sufficient size.  However
the subtract to calculate the next MAC size is preceded by an INC CX
for the next segment calculation, hence it is expected to underflow
(JB) if it fits exactly and not to underflow if it leaves one or more
para which need to be linked into the chain.
