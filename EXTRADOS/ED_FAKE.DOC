Fix Bug When Running Win95

In an earlier TWT, I introduced a bug when running under Win95 where
we updated the fields in the fake PSP when it wasn't allocated.  This
time, I'm checking to see if it's been allocated before blasting away.

HARP_INS.ASM	Check for FAKE_PSP allocated before writing into it
		  (who can argue with that?).
