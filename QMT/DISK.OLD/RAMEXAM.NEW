Additional RAMexam Options
==========================

/K:  In cases where there are no memory managers present when RAMexam is
run, rapid keystrokes may cause a keyboard lockup during RAMexam testing.
Using /K may stabilize keyboard activity.

/V:  Some 486 machines equipped with VLSI chipsets (82C480) with the Level
2 external cache may lock or reboot when RAMexam is executed.  Using /V
will disable the external cache and allow RAMexam to run to completion.

DOS 6 MultiConfig support and RSETUP
====================================

If you have DOS 6 MultiConfig and configure RAMexam to run in ALL
sections, RSETUP will install RAMexam at the beginning of AUTOEXEC.BAT
At this point, you cannot reconfigure RAMexam to run in specific
MultiConfig sections unless you remove the reference to RAMexam in
AUTOEXEC.BAT.  After removing RAMexam from AUTOEXEC.BAT, rerun RSETUP /R
to select individual MultiConfig sections.
