			    RAMExam To Do

* Use execute cycles as well as read/write cycles to test memory.

* Test memory around the SIMM boundary to catch timing errors.

* Finish alarms for various events.

* Finish continuing testing after first error.

* Log memory errors based upon granularity (e.g. 4KB).

* Excise bad memory with XMS allocations.

* Tweak memory timings to find maximal setting.

* Change SCAS to MOV/CMP to save incorrect value if NMI.

* Design your own test, e.g. W0U R0D, etc.

* Copy code to video memory when changing memory timing settings.

				 Done

* Use paging when starting in RM so that the code, but not the data
  can be cached.

* When testing continuously, count iterations.
