Fix Bug When Checking For Extended Memory

When I put in the code to check for extended memory using INT 15h,
function E801 in order to workaround a bug in certain Phoenix BIOSes,
I put the code in the wrong place.  It should precede the code which
fails on the Phoenix BIOSes, not follow it.

MEM_MAIN.ASM	    Switch the order in which we check for extended
		      memory.
