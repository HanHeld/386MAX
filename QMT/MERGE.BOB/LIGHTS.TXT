; This file contains the default light generations
;	for various events encountered when running RAMexam.
; To enable use of these lights, specify the keyword LIGHTS,
;	followed (optionally) by the drive, path, filename,
;	and extension of a file similar to this one.

; The format of each set of lights is a sequence of one
;	or more triplets of the form
;	(value, duration, pause)
;	followed by an optional repeat count (0 if none specified).
; To cause the lights to repeat for a long time, use a large
;	number (up to 65535).
; You may specify up to 32 light triplets per event.
; To terminate a light display, press any key.

; The "value" is a number from 0 to 7 which is sent to the port
;	identified in the "port=" statement.  The bit pattern of the number
;	is as follows:
;		001 = Red
;		010 = Yellow
;		100 = Green
; The "duration" and "pause" numbers are in units of timer ticks
;   (approx 18 per sec)
; The grammar for the triplet is as follows:
;	number	 := 0 to 65535
;	value	 := number
;	duration := number
;	pause	 := number
;	triplet  := (value, duration, pause)
;	trips	 := triplet
;		 := trips triplet
;	repeat	 := number
;	test	 := trips
;		 := trips , repeat
