This program allocates XMS memory such that the specified memory range
is the only XMS memory available.

Syntax:  XMSBLK xx - yy

where xx and yy are decimal values with xx >= 1 MB and xx < yy.

Either argument may be in units of kilobytes if followed by K, or in
megabytes if followed by M, however both arguments must be on a
kilobyte boundary.

For example, to specify a range of 12 MB to 15 MB, use

  12M - 15M

The dash between the numbers is optional.
