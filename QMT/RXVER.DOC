Use Qualitas MAX Version In QMT/RAMEXAM

Use the version # from Qualitas MAX as the version # for both QMT and
RAMEXAM.

MAKEFILE	Define rule for Q vs. O dependency.  Note that this
		  rule must come before the ones for R and E; if not,
		  then VERSBETA.ASM will come from the 386MAX
		  directory, not the local directory.
		Change references of VERSION.* to VERSRET.*
