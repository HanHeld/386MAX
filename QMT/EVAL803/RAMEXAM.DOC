* Quick Start & RSetup

Thank you for purchasing Qualitas RAMexam.  With it, you can use your
PC with the confidence that your system RAM is functioning properly.

Installing RAMexam

Installing RAMexam is a simple task:

1. Place the RAMexam diskette in the diskette drive.

2. Type A:  and press enter.  (If you are installing from a drive
other than A substitute that drive letter.)

3. Type RSETUP and press enter.  If the Qualitas Memory Tester is
already installed (Qualitas MAX v. 7 & 8 includes QMT), RSetup
replaces QMT with RAMexam.  RAMexam includes all the features provided
by QMT, and more.

4. RSetup prompts you for information, including your name, RAMexam
serial number and the directory you want RAMexam installed into.

5. If you use MS-DOS 6 MultiConfig, RSetup asks into which
configuration RAMexam should install.  The section "Ways to Use
RAMexam" makes specific suggestions about taking advantage of RAMexam
in a MultiConfig setup.

6. RSetup displays the scheduled testing setup screen on which you can
tell RSetup to install a RAMexam command into your AUTOEXEC.BAT file
for automated testing.  You may choose to schedule when RAMexam runs
from the following options:

        Whenever the system starts (or is rebooted)
        Daily (the first time the system is turned on or booted each day)
        Weekly (you choose which day of the week)
        Monthly (you choose which day of the month)
        User Defined (every n days where n is any number)

During installation, you have the opportunity to view any changes (and
abort them) before they are made to your start-up files.  If you
choose to allow RSetup to make the changes then your original files
will be backed-up in the RAMexam directory.


* Optimal Testing and MAKEBOOT.EXE

The Qualitas Memory Tester includes a program called MAKEBOOT.EXE that
creates a bootable diskette configured to test your system without any
resident software active.  This is optimal for testing effectiveness.
To use MAKEBOOT you need a formatted floppy disk.  MAKEBOOT deletes
all existing files from this diskette.  The diskette needs to be the
correct size to fit in drive A (unless your system boots from another
floppy).  Put the diskette into the drive and enter:

        MAKEBOOT a: [c:]

where a:  is the destination drive and c:  is the optional drive
letter from which you normally boot (do not include the brackets).
MAKEBOOT asks you to choose between having a Full or Quick test run
when booting from the floppy.  A Quick test usually takes under a
minute but is not as thorough as a Full test which can take several
hours.  MAKEBOOT transfers the necessary system files to the diskette
and creates appropriate start-up files.  To use this diskette, place
it in drive A:  and restart your system.  After testing completes,
remove the diskette and restart your system once more to return to
your original configuration.

* What is Memory?

The term "computer memory" is ambiguous.  It is often used to describe
fixed and floppy disk storage, system and adapter "read only memory"
(ROM), video adapter "random access memory" (RAM) and so on.  For the
purpose of this documentation, the term "computer memory" (or just
"memory") refers to the row or rows of system RAM chips that exist
somewhere in your PC.  This is the memory in which your software runs
and it is the memory RAMexam tests.

Few components in your PC are as crucial to its operation as memory
and the hardware which manages memory.  Defective memory can cause
data loss, prevent your monitor from displaying properly or even cause
your hard disk to crash.  Every element in your system depends on the
correct operation of RAM.

The capacity of PC memory to store information is measured in bytes.
A typical PC comes standard with several megabytes of RAM.  A megabyte
equals one million bytes (actually 1,048,576) - approximately the
amount of memory needed to hold the text for a 600 page paperback
novel.  Each byte on an IBM compatible system contains eight bits.
This means that the average PC with four megabytes of RAM has over 33
million bits -- each one ready and waiting for your valuable
information.

Let's take a look at just one bit.  Each bit "holds" one of two values
-- 0 or 1 -- depending on its electrical state.  All the information
in your PC amounts to nothing more than a series of bits, each one
holding a 0 or 1. For example, the word "memory" has six characters,
each represented as a byte in memory, for a total of 48 bits of
information:

01101101 01100101 01101101 01101111 01110010 01111001
m        e        m        o        r        y

Each bit is significant.  What would happen if the last bit was stored
in a defective memory chip and was stuck as zero?  The new word would
be "memorx".  And if your software program got loaded into the
defective bit then there is a very good chance your system would
crash.  Your PC operates on the assumption that each bit (all 33
million in the above example) functions perfectly every time you use
your PC.


* Why Memory Fails

People expect most machines to break eventually.  We look at all the
moving parts -- hard drives spinning rapidly for hours on end, car
engines running for thousands of miles -- and we know that eventually
the machine will stop working.  We see it happen every day.

Why, then, should we be so surprised to learn that system memory also
fails?  RAM itself may not spin, chug or move but it is acted upon in
countless ways -- ways that, given RAM's fragile nature, can have
devastating effects.

In addition to faulty RAM, RAMexam may detect errors which occur due
to faults in the memory subsystem - the hardware that manages the RAM.
Unfortunately, there is no way for software to determine the
difference between defective RAM and a defective memory subsystem.
The causes for failure, though, are the same.

Here are some of the most common (though by no means all) reasons that
system memory fails:

Static Electricity

If you have opened your personal computer then you know that under the
metal case are relatively vulnerable electronics.  Brushing against
system RAM while carrying even the slightest static charge can destroy
chips by subjecting them to momentary discharges of excessive
electricity.

Power Surges (large and small)

We all know about the devastating effect lightning can have on a PC.
While a $20 surge protector may reduce risk, it does not eliminate it.
In fact, power brown-outs -- where power levels dip momentarily
(because somebody upstairs just started their blow dryer) are not
handled by most surge protectors and can be just as damaging over time
as surges.  Actually, your PC is hit with a power surge every time it
is turned on and electricity rushes into the cold system.  Even when
these brown-outs and surges do not cause immediate problems, they can
stress the semiconductor chips, which has a cumulative damaging
effect.

Dust, Smoke and Pet Hair

Did you ever wonder why the television is usually the dustiest spot in
the house?  Dust and other air impurities are attracted by the
electrical charge of inside appliances like your television and PC
where they layer onto components including system memory.  Over time,
these materials can build up enough to carry electrical charges and
"short" the PC's circuitry.  The dust also forms a blanket,
diminishing the electronics' ability to release heat and stay cool.
This results in heat stress and additional potential damage.

Changes in Temperature

Put your hand on the back of a PC that has been running for several
hours.  It is very warm.  As with all things, PC components expand
when their temperatures increase.  Components of different materials
(like the metal RAM prongs and the plastic material to which it is
attached) expand and contract at different rates.  Listen closely to
your PC creak when turned off after hours of use.  This expansion and
contraction can, over time, stress the system RAM as well as the
connections between the RAM and the other components.


Though we can take precautions, there are no guaranteed methods for
eliminating all chances of memory error.  What we can do, though, is
minimize the chances of losing work because of defective memory by
using RAMexam to test system memory regularly.


* A Word About Windows & Memory Testing

When Microsoft Windows starts up, one of the first things it does is
to grab almost every available byte of system memory.  Conventional
memory, high DOS memory (UMBs) and extended memory are all allocated.
This means two important things for RAMexam users:

1) RAMexam can only test available memory -- which doesn't exist once
Windows has allocated all of it.  RAMexam does not run in a DOS
session under Windows because there is effectively no memory available
for testing.

2) Windows users should be especially zealous about doing periodic RAM
testing because Windows is one of the few applications to use the
multiple megabytes of RAM on most systems.  Frequently, a systems run
without incident until Windows loads -- at which point Windows
accesses a byte of bad RAM that had never been used before.  RAMexam
testing is an effective pre-treatment because it warns you about
defective RAM before Windows (and your work) trip over it.


* How RAMexam Tests

Memory is a collection of individual bits.  Any time a bit fails to
change its value correctly or erroneously changes its value then a RAM
error occurs.  Most (though not all) RAM that fails once will do so
again.  RAMexam uses exhaustive testing to invoke, trap and report RAM
errors before they affect your application software.

Unlike other memory testers, RAMexam uses an underlying consistent
fault model to detect RAM errors efficiently even in complex, multiple
fault situations.  Using sophisticated strategies of writing and
reading bit patterns in memory -- where each strategy targets a
specific type of failure -- RAMexam provides faster and more
comprehensive and effective testing.

Here is a description of the categories of failures for which RAMexam
tests:

Stuck-at:  One or more bits retain the value that exists in the memory
when the system boots, regardless of attempts to write new values into
the memory.

Transition:  Once changed, the value in the defective bit becomes
stuck-at.

Unlinked Inversion:  A bit changes erroneously as the result of a
change to a bit elsewhere in memory.

Linked Inversion:  A bit changes erroneously as the result of changes
to two or more other bits elsewhere in memory.

Unlinked Idempotent:  A bit becomes stuck-at as the result of a change
to a bit elsewhere in memory.

Linked Idempotent:  A bit becomes stuck-at as the result of changes to
two or more other bits elsewhere in memory.

RAMexam detects singular and multiple (coupled) occurrences of the
above errors.

From the basic display, RAMexam provides two testing options:  Quick
and Full.  Selecting Quick is the same as choosing the transition
fault test from the advanced display.  Selecting Full is the same as
choosing the two idempotent tests from the advanced display.  All
tests can be accessed by name from the advanced display.  Press
ALT-Tab to toggle between basic and advanced displays.


* Ways to Use RAMexam

The Qualitas Memory Tester may be used several ways:

  * You can run RAMexam every time you boot your system by including
RAMexam in your AUTOEXEC.BAT.  When running RAMexam this way, you
should use the command line switch for a "Quick" test.  Use RSetup to
configure your system this way automatically.  Running RAMexam at
system start-up adds between a few seconds and a few minutes to the
time it takes to boot your system, depending on how much memory you
have and the speed of your system.

  * You can run RAMexam as often as you like from the DOS prompt by
typing RAMexam and pressing enter.  Once RAMexam is running, select
the test(s) you wish to run.

  * RAMexam can test available memory only (you wouldn't want RAMexam
to write over memory in use by another program).  For extensive
testing, you can use RAMexam on a "clean" system without resident
software such as disk caches, RAM disks and memory managers active.
Running RAMexam with no other software active is the most effective
way to test your system.  The program MAKEBOOT.EXE creates a bootable
floppy for this purpose.  If you are using MS-DOS 6 MultiConfig or
similar utility then you may wish to create a clean boot configur-
ation which executes the following line:

                d:\path\RAMexam FULL=1

where d: is the drive on which RAMexam is installed and path is the
directory.  This provides an easy way to test your system memory
fully.

To start RAMexam, you must be in the RAMexam directory or it must be
included in your DOS search path.


* A Note for OS/2 Users

RAMexam can test the memory on systems that run OS/2.  In fact,
RAMexam tests RAM on any Intel 386, 486 or Pentium-compatible
microprocessor or above regardless of the operating system.  First,
you need access to a system running DOS so you can install RAMexam on
that system and use MAKEBOOT.EXE to create a bootable test diskette.
(MAKEBOOT does not run in an OS/2 DOS session because OS/2 does not
support the necessary DOS SYS.COM command.)  Once you have your
bootable diskette use it as described above.  Remember to observe
copyright restrictions and use DOS and RAMexam only on the systems for
which they are licensed.


* Navigating RAMexam

There are two RAMexam displays available, Basic and Advanced.  When
RAMexam starts, it displays the Basic screen.  Three windows make up
the Basic display.  The window in the upper left corner of the screen
displays the program name and copyright.  The window in the upper
right portion of the screen displays two buttons labeled Quick and
Full.  Select the desired test using the right and left cursor (arrow)
keys.  Press enter to start the test.  The third window, centered in
the bottom half of the screen, displays test progress.

RAMexam's Advanced screen is for users who want to see the nuts and
bolts of memory testing.  Users may switch between the Advanced and
Basic screens using Alt-Tab (even while testing).

There are four windows on the Advanced display, one of which (in the
top, left corner) is the same as in the Basic display.

The Test Selection window, in the top right corner of the screen,
displays the names of the six different memory tests.  Each test name
is followed by a field in which you may enter the number of times
RAMexam should run the test.  Enter "C" to instruct RAMexam to run the
test continually until interrupted by the user.

The Memory to Test window, in the lower left corner of the screen,
displays the memory regions which RAMexam has identified.  Regions
displayed in gray are in use by other software (such as a disk cache)
or are not physically present and cannot be tested.

The Test Status window appears in the lower right corner and includes
the estimated time to test completion.  While running, RAMexam reads
and writes (abbreviated in the display as "Rd" and "Wr") various test
patterns into memory.  This activity appears in the Status window.

ESC             returns to help menu


* A Memory Error!  Now What?

If you are fortunate, RAMexam will never find a memory error on your
system.  When RAMexam detects defective or damaged RAM then the test
halts and a red warning box appears with all known information about
the error.

Unfortunately, RAMexam cannot tell you which chip is the culprit.
Software accesses memory through special hardware that is responsible
for addressing the individual chips.  There is information within this
hardware that maps the memory address used by software to a physical
bit within a chip.  This information is not accessible to software and
varies widely from system to system.  Should RAMexam detect defective
RAM, here are the recommended steps to take:

  * See if the error is reproducible.  If a memory error only happens
once and cannot be reproduced it may not be cause for alarm.
Occasionally, alpha particle radiation -- which may not recur -- can
cause memory failure.

  * If the memory error recurs, take your system to a qualified repair
facility.  Virtually every system manufacturer uses a unique memory
architecture so that it is impossible for RAMexam to identify specific
memory chips to replace.  DO NOT ATTEMPT TO REPLACE YOUR RAM UNLESS
YOU ARE QUALIFIED.  (If you are not sure if you are qualified then you
probably are not.)  All error information is saved into the RAMexam
log file in the RAMexam directory.

  * Diagnosis of memory errors, beyond that offered by RAMexam,
requires hands-on interaction with the problem system.  It also
frequently requires special equipment.  For these reasons, Qualitas
Technical Support cannot assist you in locating faulty memory chips.
You should contact a Qualitas technician only if you believe that
RAMexam itself is not functioning correctly.


* How to Avoid Memory Errors

As with most of life, a byte of prevention is worth a megabyte of
cure.  Maintaining a proper environment for your PC can significantly
reduce the chance of memory failure.  Here are some tips:

  * Work in a dust free environment.

  * Keep pets away from computer work areas.

  * Do not smoke in the same room as your PC.

  * Plug your PC into its own electrical circuit.

  * Use a surge protector or, even better, an uninterruptable power
        supply (UPS).

  * If you use a modem or fax board, make sure that you use a
        telephone line surge protector.

  * Never touch the inside of your PC without first grounding
        yourself.

Even with these precautions, there is no guarantee that RAM will not
fail.  RAM testing, though, significantly reduces the risk of losing
work to defective RAM.
