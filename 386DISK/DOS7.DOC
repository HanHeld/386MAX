Distinguish Between MS-DOS 7 and PC-DOS 7

Previously, we ran into trouble on MS-DOS 7 systems where Win95
changed the allowable minimum and maximum bytes-per-sector values, and
thus our RAM disk wasn't recognized under Win95.  Because I didn't
have a way to distinguish MS- and PC-DOS systems, I used the new
values for both on the theory that therer are more MS-DOS than PC-DOS
systems out there.  Now, I've found a way to tell them apart.

A little known (to me, at least) feature of the DOS Get Version
(AH=30h) call is that it takes a subfunction in AL which when AL=0,
returns the DOS OEM number in BH.  Pleasantly, both IBM and Microsoft
have entries in this table (found in Ralf Brown's interrupt list) and
the entries are different (and appropriately polarized at 00 and FF,
respectively).

The only remaining issue is what to do with all of the other OEM
numbers.  For these, I propose to check for IBM or not IBM only on the
theory that if there are non-IBM DOS 7s out there, they are more
likely to be based on the Microsoft code than the IBM code.

At the same time, I converted MAKEFILE over to use the VERSRET.ASM
from the 386MAX project so it now tracks that product's version
number.  This is then one fewer file we need to remember to change for
new versions.

MAKEFILE	Use VERSRET.ASM from the 386MAX project for version #.

DOSOEM.INC	New file with all of the known DOS OEM numbers.

QDISK_IN.ASM	Save DOS OEM number.
		Check for it.
