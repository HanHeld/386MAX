Remove Interrupt Disabling Code

Originally, I coded GDADRV.ASM to handle the case where its hooks
could be called re-entrantly.  This meant disabling interrupts for
what proved to be unacceptably long periods of time.  As it turns out,
the routines we hook cannot be called re-entrantly, so I've removed
the PUSHF/CLI/.../POPF_MAC code.  Speaking of which, there was a bug
in POPF_MAC which clobbered AH if the register into which it was
popped wasn't AX.

GDADRV.ASM	Fix bug in POPF_MAC by using a different algorithm
		  which doesn't use a user-designated register into
		  which it pops the flags.
		Delete PUSHF/CLI/.../POPF_MAC code.
