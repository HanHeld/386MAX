Handle Incompatible Drivers, Part II


New dialogs are defined for Toolbox and MAX Setup as well as changes
to the one for when GOAHEAD.EXE encounters Go Ahead in a disabled
state.

* When uninstalling Go Ahead, delete the .EXE from the user's startup
  group.  This involves using SETUPDDE.C from Toolbox.

* The dialogs for Toolbox and MAX Setup are now made available as
  DLL entry points in GOAHEAD.DRV.

* Define new return value (4) to LCLDRV_QUERYENABLE for disabled due
  to incompatible drivers.

* When uninstalling GOAHEAD.DRV, delete GOAHEAD.EXE from StartUp
  group.




MAKEFILE	Define dependencies for SETUPDDE.C.

GDADRV.DEF	Define export for Dialog display entry point.
		Remove leading underscore from GALoadClear() as C
		  provides for that automatically.

GDADRV.INC	Define additional flags for whether or not various
		  hooks are installed so we may call FN_DRV_FREE at
		  all times.
		Include flag for disabled due to incompatible drivers
		  in other disabled flags.

GDADRV.ASM	In FN_DRV_FREE, test flags to see if we should
		  uninstall/unhook each feature.
		Move call to ReadIncompat() to follow NotifyRegister()
		  so we can track the # tasks even if we're disabled.
		Delete test around call to FN_DRV_FREE as we now use
		  individual tests.
		Return 4 if disabled due to incompatible driver.
		Delete test for installed in response to DRV_LOAD msg
		  so we can stay resident, but disabled.

GDARID.ASM	Define separate dialogs for GOAHEAD.EXE, SETUP.EXE,
		  and TOOLBOX.EXE (the latter two share the same
		  dialog).
		Fill in CenterWindow() function.
		Use DialogBoxParm() instead of DialogBox() so we can
		  handle multiple dialog windows.
		Parametrize dialog box procedure for multiple windows.
		When uninstalling, delete GOAHEAD.EXE from the StartUp
		  group.
		Rename SkipString() to SkipPath() and check for CR. LF
		  in tests.
		Delete call to GADialog() from within ReadIncompat()
		  as that's now a separate call.

GOAHEAD.C	Handle case of disabled due to incompatible driver.

RESAPP.H	Define equates for disabled due to incompatible
		  driver.

RESDRV.H	Define equate for StartUp group string.

APPELSE.RC	Define value for StartUp group string.

DRVELSE.RC	Change dialog used by GOAHEAD.EXE for incompatible
		  drivers.
		Define new dialog used by Toolbox and Setup for
		  incompatible drivers.

Toolbox
-------

SETUPDDE.C	Replace unneeded "toolbox.h" with needed <windows.h>.
		In order to allow this module to be complied as Small
		  model, use local variable as argument to sscanf.
