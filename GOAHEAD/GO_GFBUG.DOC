Fix Bug When Installing/Uninstalling GlobalFree Hook

In a previous TWT, I optimized the code so as not to hook GlobalFree()
unless we need to.  Alas, I missed some places where this is
referenced, which this TWT corrects.

GDADRV.ASM	Put tests around install/uninstall of local
		  GlobalFree() routine.
