Handle GoAhead When Run On US Windows With German Contry Code.

Goa Ahead is now sensitive to being run on US Windows with a German
country code in effect.  In particular, it checks for the latter and
uses "AutoStart" as the startup group name.

GDARID.ASM	Define variables for [intl] iCountry=nn.
		Test country code to see which startup group string to
		  use.

DRVELSE.RC	Define strings for US and German startup group names.

GDADRV.INC	Define equates (same as is RESDRV.H) for startup
		  groups strings.

RESDRV.H	Define equates for startup group strings.
