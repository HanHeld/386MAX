Workaround Bug In SNDBLST2.DRV

When GOAHEAD.DRV loads before MMSYSTEM.DLL and that driver further
loads an early Sound Blaster driver (SNDBLST2.DRV which ships with
Windows), there is an incompatibility (no sound).  When Go Ahead is
loaded first, it sucks up all low DOS, and so fixed memory is always
allocated in extended memory.  When the Sound Blaster driver is
loaded, it GlobalAlloc()s fixed memory and fails if the base linear
address if >= 16MB which is the case with Go Ahead.  Of course the
driver should be checking for the PHYSICAL address >= 16MB, but that
detail escaped them.

Because of this, we need to install our driver after MMSYSTEM.DLL
under certain curcumstances, which works around this problem.  Also,
to handle future cases, the following algorithm is used:

1.  If there is a "LoadAfter=" line in the [Go Ahead - General]
    section of QMAX.INI, or

2.  If SNDBLST2.DRV is present in the [Drivers] section of SYSTEM.INI
    for any of the keywords "wave=", "wavenn=" (where nn can range
    from 0 to 99), "midi=", "midinn=" (nn has the same range),

then we load our driver after the file named in the "LoadAfter=" line
in the [Go Ahead - General] section of QMAX.INI or "mmsystem.dll" if
there is no "LoadAfter=" line.


MAKEFILE	Define dependencies for new modules.

MISCFNS.INC	Define equates for MISCFNS.ASM

GDADRV.ASM	Instead of having assemble time debugging code, a
		  "debug=1" keyword is checked for in the [Go Ahead -
		  General] section of QMAX.INI.
		Numerous new keywords are defined to support the above
		  changes.
		String functions as well as some previously local
		  functions are now in external modules.
		If GFAlloc=1 is not present in [Go Ahead - General]
		  section of QMAX.INI, don't bother to hook or free
		  a local GlobalFree() function.
		Define new routine FindDriver() to locate our driver
		  in the "drivers=" line of [boot] section of
		  SYSTEM.INI.
		Define new routines GPPS_Blast() and FindBlaster() to
		  search for SNDBLST2.DRV in various lines in
		  [drivers] section of SYSTEM.INI.
		In UpdateDrivers(), implement the above rules.

MISCFNS.ASM	Separate out miscellaneous functions.

STRFNS.ASM	Define common string functions.
