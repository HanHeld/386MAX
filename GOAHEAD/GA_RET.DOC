Return Proper Result

A function which should return a result didn't.  This didn't matter on
Win 3.1, but can on Win95 as the function which is called after
setting the result variable clobbers a different set of registers.
However, as GOAHEAD isn't used on Win95, this isn't too serious a
problem.  Nonetheless, in the interests of good housekeeping...

GOAHEAD.C	In LclFileVersion(), end with "return ret".
