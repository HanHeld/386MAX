Fix Another Parsing Bug Skipping Over Path

When skipping over the path on a driver, I didn't handle the cases
correctly.  In particular, I searched for the first backslash instead
of the last one.  This change actually simplifes the code by searching
forwards through the string saving the offset of the last drive and
path separator, and stopping on any line terminator (<=' ').

At the same time, I fixed two bugs in the .EXE program.

* Set fRID flag before displaying the dialog box so we avoid
  reentrancy problems (such as multiple displays of the dialog box).

* If GOAHEAD.EXE is disabled due to incompatible drivers and it is
  invoked as a minimized app, we should ignore that and restore it to
  normal size.	Without this change, a minimized StartUp group entry
  won't display the incompatible driver dialog box until the user
  restores the window to normal size.


GDARID.ASM	In SkipPath() search forwards saving the offset of the
		  character after any driver separator (=':') or path
		  separator (='\') and stopping at any line terminator
		  (<=' ').

GOAHEAD.C	Move set of fRID flag to precede call to DialogBox.
		Move call to ShowWindow() to follow read of enable
		  state and test for disabled due to incompatible
		  drivers.
