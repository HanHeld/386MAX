Fix Near/Far Bug In Maximize

For some reason, the variables of UTIL_OPT.ASM which are referenced by
the C code in MAXIMIZE were declared as near, even though they are
far.  The MS-LINKer made a misguided attempt to make the error work,
failed miserably, and then compounded this mistake by ignoring the
problem.

The net effect of this problem is (at least for one of the variables,
BESTSIZE) that MAXIMIZE reports the number of bytes moved high as a
random number (it once reported 920K going high on my system at home).
There might be other bugs fixed by this change, but I haven't
investigated.

At the same time, I noticed that a couple of variables in INTHELP.H
weren't declared extern in a non-OWNER module, which caused the
compiler to treat them as COMDEF records.  As there is a PUBDEF record
for these variables, the linker should signal an error, but of course
once again it ignored the problem.

INTHELP.H	Precede variables with GLOBAL.

MAXVAR.H	Declare variables from UTIL_OPT.ASM as far.
