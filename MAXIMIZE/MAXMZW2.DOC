Fixes to DOS Maximize in support of WinMaxim

Fix file entry:

* Fixes to DOS Maximize in support of WinMaxim

 Description:
 	Quite a number of bugs and features have been implemented
	with respect to running Maximize starting from Windows.
	1. Express and Custom are now used, with /E and /U the
	   enabling command line options.
	2. Force settings selected in WinMaxim to control
	   Maximize's behaviour more fully (no dialogs).
	3. Fix placement of Winmaxim statement in autoexec
	   for final reboot.
	4. Modify CONFIG.SYS to boot into the selected MultiConfig
	   section for final reboot.
	5. In WinMaxim, if enabling ROMSRCH when it has already
	   been run, turn on "Remove ROMSRCH" by default (it can
	   still be turned back off).
 Who: HENRY
 When: 26 Oct 95.
 SW/HW Environment: WinMaxim (starting Maximize from Windows or
 	Win95)
 Symptom: See MaxMzW2.DOC for details.
 Temporary Workaround: None.
 Test Procedure: Test Custom and Express Maximize, from DOS and
 	from WinMaxim, in Windows and Win95 environments.
 QA Testing Passed:
 Version: WinMaxim 8.0.16.003; Maximize 8.0.5

New files:

MAXIMIZE\MAXIMIZE.INC
	DEPSCAN-generated dependency list

Files affected:

MAXIMIZE\MAKEFILE
	Use Depscan-generated dependency list.

MAXIMIZE\MAX_SYS.H
	Change product name to Qualitas Max

MAXIMIZE\MAXIMIZE.C
	Override all other switches via Maximize.ini if started from Windows.

	Add new BREAK=n to MAXIMIZE.CFG (BREAK=* generates an int 1 earlier
	unconditionally on all phases).

	Rename /Q and /F switches to /E and /U (to match Express and Custom)

MAXIMIZE\MAXTEXT.H
	Make redundancy message global.  We now use it as a marker for
	lines to be removed from CONFIG.SYS.  This also removes previously
	"marked redundant" lines.

MAXIMIZE\MAXVAR.H
	Add flag bits for BREAK=

MAXIMIZE\PARSE.C
	If VGASWAP was requested from WinMaxim but xlat/t said "no way",
	change the default setting to off.

	Add option to strip ExtraDOS from CONFIG.SYS (if turned off in
	WinMaxim, we assert whatever state is passed to us, unless
	DRDos is in the picture).

MAXIMIZE\PASS1.C
	Check for stripping of VGASWAP and USE=F000-FFFF statements.
	Note that stripping BIOS USE statements when re-running
	ROMSRCH is handled in the WinMaxim custom dialog by automatically
	turning on the "Remove ROMSRCH" checkbox.

MAXIMIZE\PASS2.C
	Add default args to profile write (no stripping).

MAXIMIZE\PASS3.C
	Don't say anything about reordering if running Express Maximize
	from Windows.

MAXIMIZE\PROCCFG1.C
	Add code to strip VGASWAP and USE= statements in the F000-FFFF
	area.

MAXIMIZE\REBOOT.C
	Rename /Q and /F options to /E and /U

MAXIMIZE\SCREENS.C
	Don't wait for progress completed if from Windows.

	Don't display "completed" screen if from Windows.

	Handle case (in placing WinMaxim) where there is no shell program
	existing in AUTOEXEC.BAT and we need to place it at the end.

	Use WinMaxim.EXE /summary to find WIN.COM and load it, passing
	the free low DOS figure along as well.

	Add 4 lines to top of CONFIG.SYS to force selection of the
	selected MultiConfig section on the fourth boot.

	Don't ask about ROMSRCH if running from Windows.  We still
	put up the dialog telling them to put a floppy in.

	Don't ask about VGASWAP either.

MAXIMIZE\UTIL.C
	Add code to read and write INI file entries, a la the Windows
	functions.

MAXIMIZE\VERSBETA.ASM
	Bump ver to 5.

MAXIMIZE\VERSDATA.ASM
	Change Quick and Full...

MAXIMIZE\WRCONFIG.C
	Filter out lines marked with "redundant" message.

MAXIMIZE\WRFILES3.C
	Add default args (no stripping).

WINMXMZ\CVERSION.H
	Bump ver to 3.

WINMXMZ\MXDLGS.CPP
WINMXMZ\MXDLGS.H
	If USE= statements in ROM exist and "Run ROMSRCH" is turned on,
	also turn on the "Remove ROMSRCH" flag to show we'll do that
	first (before rebooting in Phase 1).  The user can still turn
	it off manually.

WINMXMZ\SUMMARY.CPP
	Remove lines from start of CONFIG.SYS as well.

	Save removal requests in [Last request] section (sounds morbid,
	doesn't it?)

WINMXMZ\WINMXMZ.CPP
	Use /E and /U options for Express and Custom Maximize.

WINMXMZ\WINMXMZ.RC
	Change control orders to sane values.

	Rename "Disable ROMSRCH" to "Remove ROMSRCH" (still not accurate,
	but better than saying "Remove USE=F000-FFFF")
